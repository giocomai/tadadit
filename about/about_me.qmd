::: {#hero-heading}
I am a researcher and data analyst at [OBCT](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/)/[CCI](https://www.cci.tn.it/).

For a long time, I have been conducting research on post-Soviet affairs, focusing in particular on de facto states. I have been visiting Russia and other post-Soviet countries since 2000, and I speak fluently Russian and Romanian.

In recent years, I have increasingly been working on structured approaches for analysing online sources in conflict studies and international relations, data collection methods, and related ethical issues.

I have also been working as a data analyst and consultant, crunching data at the European Data Journalism Network ([EDJNet](https://europeandatajournalism.eu/)), writing code and developing packages in the R programming language, and working on data visualisation and geographic data analysis.
