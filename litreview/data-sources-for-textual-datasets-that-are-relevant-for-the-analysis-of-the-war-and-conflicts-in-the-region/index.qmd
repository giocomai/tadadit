This project is based on the assumption that the researcher has no access to proprietary software or proprietary datasets. For those who effectively needs them or can afford them, these are surely sensible points of reference; there may also be few good alternatives for some media formats or for large-scale analyses.

Such sources are however rarely affordable for anyone outside established academic institutions or businesses. Besides, in practice, contents generated in contested territories are rarely included in established datasets.

The textual datasets at the core of this project are generated via text mining using open source solutions in a way that can be replicated by anyone with a computer, an internet connection, and the necessary skills. However, online sources retrieved through text mining do not exist in a vacuum, and of course need not be the sole point of reference.

With this in mind, in this section I include references to potentially relevant sources.

## Reviews of different datasets/corpora

@kopotev2021 offers a review of "Corpora in Text-Based Russian Studies". They point at a variety of sources, ranging from do-it-yourself datasets to established online resources, highlighting in particular two of them: the Russian National Corpus and the Integrum database
