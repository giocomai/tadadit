Example: [African Mercenaries Escape Poverty by Coming to Die for Ukraine. Russian Media Monitoring Report, 28 November-4 December 2022](https://texty.org.ua/articles/108450/african-mercenaries-escape-poverty-by-coming-to-die-for-ukraine-russian-media-monitoring-report-28-november-4-december-2022/)

**Methodology**:

> We have built a corpus of all the materials from Russian websites and those maintained by the occupation force (almost 22,000 news items) for our weekly disinformation monitoring report. Each paragraph was processed by the algorithm which defines its topic automatically. The resulting topics (i.e. groups with similar content) were short-listed by the topics relating to the war or its consequences for Russia. The number of mentions of a certain topic was then counted for each publication. Our conclusions are based on the respective findings and the quotes from paragraphs referring to each topic.
