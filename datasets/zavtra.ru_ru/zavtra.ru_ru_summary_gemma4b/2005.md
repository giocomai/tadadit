The Way to Salvation World Notes
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-01-05 - <b> Andrey Fefelov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a reflection on the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in
contemporary Russia, arguing for its continued relevance and importance
despite criticisms and perceived shortcomings. The author contends that
the Church represents a vital, though imperfect, spiritual and social
force within a deeply divided and struggling nation.

He frames the Church not as a dominant, controlling institution, but as
a resilient, grassroots movement rooted in the everyday lives of
ordinary Russians, particularly in rural areas. The author highlights
the Church’s ability to provide a sense of community, continuity, and
national identity in a period of social and political upheaval.

Key arguments include: the Church’s role in fostering a sense of
national unity amidst societal fragmentation, its connection to
traditional Russian values and a spirit of sacrifice, and its ability to
offer a counter-narrative to the perceived negativity and
disillusionment prevalent in modern Russia. The author dismisses
simplistic criticisms of the Church as being overly conservative or
politically aligned, emphasizing instead its genuine connection to the
struggles and aspirations of the Russian people. He stresses the
importance of understanding the Church not through media portrayals, but
through direct experience and observation. Ultimately, the text presents
the Church as a crucial “resource for salvation” – a source of strength
and hope for a nation grappling with its identity and future.

<p>
The text details a complex and seemingly fabricated case against two
Russian police officers, Major V. Blohhin and Lieutenant A.A.
Konovalenko, in the town of Dolgoprudny. Initially investigating a
network of drug trafficking, the investigation was allegedly manipulated
by individuals involved in the drug trade, including drug dealers and
criminals. The officers were falsely accused of abuse of power, with
fabricated evidence and a lack of credible witnesses hindering the
prosecution. The case was repeatedly delayed and manipulated, with the
alleged perpetrators disappearing and the investigation focusing on
discrediting the officers. The text highlights concerns about
corruption, the manipulation of legal processes, and the broader issue
of drug trafficking within Russia.

A Russian physicist, Danilov, is being detained following an interview
with the Los Angeles Times, initially accused of leaking secret space
technology to China. The situation is viewed as a potential manipulation
by the United States, aiming to halt Russian-Chinese collaboration in
the space sector. American interest is fueled by concerns about China’s
military growth and a desire to control technology supply. Academics
have stated that scientific collaborations are always under intelligence
agency oversight. The legal proceedings, including a previous acquittal
and subsequent prosecution, suggest conflicting interests and potential
interference from the US. The situation highlights risks for Russian
scientists engaging in international collaborations, particularly with
the possibility of US intervention.

Plague in universities
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-01-12 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of recent legislative changes in
Russia, specifically targeting the impact on higher education and
students. It argues that the “United Russia” party, in conjunction with
President Putin, is deliberately dismantling the system of support for
universities and students.

Key criticisms include: the removal of state funding for universities,
the elimination of student benefits like free meals, transportation, and
healthcare, the privatization of university facilities (including
restrooms), and the transformation of universities into for-profit,
state-controlled entities.

The author contends that these changes are driven by a deliberate
attempt to reduce the state’s role in education, prioritizing profit
over the needs of students and educators. The text expresses outrage at
what it perceives as a systematic attack on the future of Russian higher
education and a disregard for the rights of students and faculty. It
frames the situation as a deliberate act of oppression, fueled by a
desire to reduce the state’s role in education and shift control to
private interests.

This text expresses a pessimistic view of the political situation in
Ukraine, arguing that both Viktor Yanukovych and Vladimir Putin are
controlled figures operating through external channels. It critiques the
“Orange Revolution” and subsequent events, portraying them as part of a
larger manipulation. The author suggests that the conflict in Ukraine is
driven by economic and cultural divisions, particularly between the
Russian-speaking East and West, and that the situation risks escalating
into a civil war with potential international involvement. The text
highlights the perceived betrayal of the East by the “Наша Украина” bloc
and warns of a potential “failed state” and ongoing conflict zone. It
also references specific policies, such as the 2005 passport

Across Russia, protests against the monetization of social benefits
continued in January 2024. Multiple cities – including Вологда, Ufa,
Tver, Ulyanovsk, Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, and Moscow – saw
demonstrations involving thousands of pensioners, students, and
opposition figures, primarily from the “Rodina” party and affiliated
groups. These protests demanded the reinstatement of previously held
social benefits and called for resignations of government officials,
including Minister Zubarev. Several individuals initiated hunger strikes
in support of these demands, with a group of six continuing the strike
in Chelyabinsk. Technical difficulties, such as website outages and

ISLANDS FROM UNDER THE WATER
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-02-02 - <b> Igorʹ Latyshev </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a strongly worded critique of current diplomatic efforts
between Russia and Japan, particularly regarding the Kuril Islands
dispute. It argues that Japan is using the 150th anniversary of the
Simodsky Treaty (a treaty signed in 1855 that ceded southern Kuril
Islands to Japan) as a manipulative tactic to pressure Russia into
conceding more territory.

The author, Igor Latyshev, contends that Japan’s actions are driven by a
desire to rewrite history and regain control of the islands, leveraging
historical grievances and anniversaries to achieve their goals. He
highlights the historical context of the treaty’s signing – a period
where Russia was weakened by war and Japan exploited this vulnerability.

Latyshev criticizes the current approach of Russian diplomats,
suggesting they are being swayed by a desire for “compromise” and
potentially sacrificing Russian sovereignty. He emphasizes that the
Simodsky Treaty was unilaterally annulled by Japan after its victory in
World War II and that the islands are now permanently part of Russia. He
dismisses the anniversary celebrations as a manipulative ploy and urges
Russia to resist pressure to cede further territory, advocating instead
for a reaffirmation of Russia’s rightful ownership. The text concludes
with a warning against succumbing to Japan’s attempts to reframe the
historical narrative and maintain Russia’s firm stance on the Kuril
Islands.

2005-02-09 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a scathing, satirical account of the privatization era in
Russia, told through a series of interconnected anecdotes and
observations by a Samara-based writer, Evgeny Chebalin. It depicts a
chaotic and corrupt system where former Soviet-era managers and
entrepreneurs engaged in endless legal battles and manipulations over
factories and assets. The narrative highlights the destructive
consequences of unchecked capitalism, portraying a cycle of fraud,
exploitation, and legal maneuvering driven by individuals like a former
polytechnic director, a young shipbuilder, and a newspaper editor. The
story emphasizes the lack of accountability, the prevalence of
corruption, and the deep-seated resentment felt by those caught in the
upheaval of the market economy. Ultimately, it suggests that genuine
change can only come from individual acts of resistance and a defense of
personal dignity against the excesses of the market.

recent global events. It argues that Prokhanov’s work, viewed through

<p>
This text is a scathing critique of Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy,
arguing that Russia’s current isolation in the CIS stems directly from
its own actions over the past two decades. The author contends that
Putin’s policies, characterized by concessions and a failure to secure
“redemptory payments,” have alienated former allies and fueled the rise
of anti-Russian sentiment in countries like Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia,
and the Baltic states. Specifically, the text details how Russia has
repeatedly handed opportunities to anti-Russian forces, allowing them to
align with Western institutions and ultimately undermining Russia’s
influence. The author highlights examples such as the support for
pro-Western leaders in Ukraine and Moldova, the failed intervention in
Georgia, and the increasingly hostile stance towards the Baltic states,
culminating in the proposal to grant the Kaliningrad region “foreign
territory” status. The overall argument is that these actions represent
not a strategic error, but a deliberate and systematic betrayal of
Russia’s national interests.

Moldova’s recent parliamentary elections saw the Party of Communists
(PCRM), led by Igor Volovnenko, win the most votes (46.1%), followed by
the Democratic Movement (around 30%) and the Christian Democratic
People’s Party (9.7%). Despite this victory, Volovnenko’s ties to Russia
remain strained, marked by accusations of Russian interference, failed
promises, and a shift towards Western integration. The election results
have further distanced Moldova from Russia, fueled by Western support
and a move towards European alignment, while also creating tensions with
neighboring countries like Ukraine and concerns for the breakaway region
of Transnistria. Russia’s influence in the region is diminishing, and
the situation highlights a complex interplay of national interests,
geopolitical maneuvering, and economic dependence.

The text expresses a triumphant and unapologetic celebration of the
Russian special forces’ actions in killing Dasturmagomedov, the leader
of the “Maschaadoff” (referring to Chechen militants). It frames the
operation as a necessary and justified act against a brutal and
dehumanized enemy, rejecting any notion of “humanity” attributed to the
militants, particularly after the school siege in Beslan. The author
criticizes “liberals” for their perceived misguided sympathy for the
militants and emphasizes the traditional, pragmatic, and ultimately
violent nature of Russian statecraft. It celebrates the soldiers’
actions, highlighting their bravery and effectiveness, and dismisses
attempts to apply liberal values to the conflict. The overall tone is
one of resolute national pride and a rejection of moral ambiguity in the
face of perceived threats.

Lithuania’s decision to close the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, built

CHINESE PROJECT WITHOUT COVERING LEGENDS
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-03-23 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text outlines China’s “Chinese Project,” a long-term plan for
national development initiated in 1959 and driven by a cyclical,
10-year, 20-year, and 60-year framework. The project, rooted in the
legacy of Mao Zedong and subsequent leadership, aims for complete
national rejuvenation by 2020, encompassing economic, demographic, and
geopolitical expansion.

Key aspects of the plan include rapid economic growth (initially 8%,
then 15%), massive currency reserves, and a significant military
buildup. China’s strategic goals involve reclaiming Taiwan, asserting
dominance over Tibet and Xinjiang, extending its borders into Russia’s
Far East regions, and establishing economic control over Southeast Asia
through organizations like ASEAN and the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization.

The text frames China’s ambitions within a “Threemountains, Four Seas”
doctrine, anticipating a global leadership role by the 2020s. A central
conflict is envisioned between China and the United States, with Russia
playing a supporting role. China’s strategy involves securing its
“strategic rear” – primarily through access to energy resources and
transportation routes – while simultaneously challenging US influence
through economic and political pressure. The text highlights a potential
“naval blockade” scenario orchestrated by the US to disrupt China’s
energy supply and frames Russia as a key strategic partner in this
confrontation. Ultimately, the project is presented as a calculated,
long-term strategy for China to achieve global dominance.

The text depicts a conversation among soldiers and cadets in a military
barracks, primarily focused on their disillusionment and anxieties. The
soldiers express frustration with low pay, canceled benefits, and a
perceived lack of opportunity, leading to a cynical and darkly humorous
outlook. They lament the state of the armed forces and their potential
to defend the country. The conversation reveals a sense of hopelessness
and a desire to escape military service. Despite the negativity, the
shared experience of smoking and informal discussions in the barracks
offer a space for honest reflection and a glimpse into the thoughts and
concerns of the individuals serving. The setting—the smoke-filled corner
of the barracks—is presented as a crucial location for understanding the
realities faced by soldiers and cadets.

2005-03-30 - <b> Maksim Zamshev </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a lengthy review and appreciation of a poetry collection
titled “Всеосень” (All Autumn) by Serbian poet Radovan Karadzic,
translated into Russian by five translators. The reviewer emphasizes
Karadzic’s status as a legendary and deeply European, philosophical poet
who embodies resistance against Western cultural influence. He
highlights the collection’s complex blend of personal biography, heroic
themes, and a defiant spirit, arguing that Karadzic’s work reflects a
struggle against the homogenization of Slavic culture. The translators
are praised for their skillful adaptation of Karadzic’s style,
particularly his use of free verse punctuated by classical rhyme
schemes. The book’s release is seen as a testament to Slavic brotherhood
and a celebration of Karadzic’s role as a national leader. The reviewer
notes the inclusion of the original Serbian text and the collaborative

2005-03-30 - <b> Pavel Bylevskiy </b>
</p>
<p>
This text argues against simplistic understandings of “revolutions” like
the “orange” or “rose” ones, asserting that a genuine, transformative
revolution in Russia requires a fundamental shift in the economic and
social structure – a replacement of the current ruling class and
privatization system with worker-led control of production and a
socialist system. It posits that attempts to manipulate public opinion
or stage superficial changes are ultimately futile and driven by a
desire to maintain the status quo. The author envisions a powerful,
historically-rooted socialist revolution that would not only reshape
Russia but also trigger a wider global shift, potentially uniting with
anti-American Islamic revolutions and reversing the dominance of the
United States and Western powers. The core argument is that a true
revolution is about fundamentally altering the system, not just
replacing leaders, and that the current attempts to create
“pseudo-revolutions” are misleading and ultimately ineffective.

<p>

This text is a lengthy reflection on the life and legacy of Cardinal
Karol Wojtyła, the Pope John Paul II. It details his rise to power
amidst the Cold War, framing his papacy as a “crusade” against
communism, particularly against the Soviet Union and Russia. The author
argues that Wojtyła’s entire life was dedicated to this fight, leading
to a deeply ingrained antagonism that shaped his actions and beliefs.

The text highlights a significant shift in perspective as Wojtyła aged
and the Soviet Union collapsed. It suggests that his lifelong opposition
was ultimately misguided, as the “evil” he fought against was revealed
to be a mere shadow of a greater evil – American influence.

The narrative emphasizes the irony of Wojtyła’s final moments, where he
listened to a performance of Russian military songs, a poignant symbol
of the conflict he had dedicated his life to combating. The author
concludes by portraying Wojtyła as a complex figure, driven by a sincere
but ultimately flawed vision, and a victim of his own convictions.

This lengthy text is a scathing critique of Anatoly Chubais and his role
in shaping contemporary Russia. It argues that Chubais and those aligned
with him are responsible for a series of disastrous economic and social
reforms, characterized by corruption, the destruction of national
wealth, and a deliberate erosion of Russian culture and identity.

The core argument is that Chubais’s actions, driven by a cynical and
self-serving agenda, have led to a “pohumor” (a devastating destruction)
of Russia, marked by: the loss of trillions in wealth, a decline in
living standards, rampant crime, the degradation of public health, the
manipulation of public opinion through propaganda, and a deliberate
undermining of national pride and values.

The text expresses deep suspicion of Chubais’s motives, suggesting he is
motivated by fear of accountability for his actions and that he is
actively working to further destabilize Russia, potentially through
orchestrated “revolutions” (like an “orange revolution”). It highlights
a perceived disconnect between Chubais’s rhetoric of progress and the
reality of the situation, accusing him of using deceptive tactics and
manipulating public opinion through a powerful “media box” (referring to

Ultimately, the text presents a pessimistic view of Russia’s future,

This interview transcript features Mikhail Delugin, an economist and
ideologue, discussing the current state of Russia and predicting a
potential social upheaval. Delugin argues that despite economic growth,
Russia faces significant problems including rising inequality, a
crumbling social safety net, and a dysfunctional bureaucracy. He
believes the current leadership, characterized by self-enrichment and
disregard for the population, is leading the country towards a “green”
revolution – a violent overthrow of the existing order.

Delugin criticizes the government’s policies, particularly the
“monetization of benefits,” and highlights the widening gap between the
rich and poor. He expresses concern about the influence of powerful
oligarchs and their control over the economy.

His proposed solution involves a fundamental shift in Russia’s role in
the world – becoming a leader in a more just global order, driven by
technological advancements and a focus on human capital development. He
emphasizes the importance of restoring social support, investing in
education and healthcare, and fostering a strong national identity.
Ultimately, Delugin believes that a return to basic values and a
commitment to social justice are essential for Russia’s future.

<h3>
AGAINST APARTHEID
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-05-11 - <b> Aleksandr Savin </b>
</p>
<p>
The text argues that the Russian Federation’s constitution and legal
framework systematically discriminate against the Russian people,
effectively creating a form of “apartheid.” It highlights Article 65,
which grants special status to federal subjects, and Article 114-F3,
which defines “extremism” to include promoting the inferiority of
citizens based on religion, race, nationality, or language. The author
contends that this leads to the marginalization and decline of the
Russian population, citing demographic losses and restrictions on their
participation in Russian society. The text demands immediate action from
the Russian government to eliminate this discrimination, proposing a
one-month response period. Failure to comply would grant the Russian
people the right to fight against discrimination and apartheid.

INEXPLICABLE SOUL
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-05-11 - <b> Vladimir Lichutin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, nostalgic, and somewhat cynical reflection on
Russian history, particularly the relationship between the peasantry
(“the lower strata”) and the state/elites (“the upper strata”). It
argues that a core element of Russian national character – a pragmatic
acceptance of taking what is needed – has been consistently misconstrued
and unfairly blamed by successive governments.

The author traces this issue through centuries, from the “banker” (a
former peasant) who learned to exploit the system, to the ongoing
accusations of peasant theft and corruption. He highlights a perceived
cyclical pattern: the state takes from the people, the people adapt and
continue to take, and the state then condemns this adaptation as vice.

A key theme is the contrast between Russian practicality and what the
author sees as a judgmental, often hypocritical, Western perspective. He
criticizes the tendency to demonize Russian resourcefulness and
self-reliance, particularly the acceptance of taking what is needed, as
theft. He emphasizes the historical context of communal land use and the
acceptance of taking from the state as a necessary part of survival. The
text concludes with a lament for the loss of a traditional, morally
ambiguous, but ultimately resilient, Russian spirit, and a condemnation
of the current state’s exploitation of the people.

The text recounts the author’s formative experiences learning about
Russian art, particularly during the early 20th century. He credits
Professor Alexei Fedorov-Davydov’s lectures at the Tretyakov Gallery
with profoundly shaping his understanding and appreciation of Russian
artists like Ilya Repin, Karl Bryullov, and Mikhail Vrubel.
Fedorov-Davydov’s approach, built on a deep love for and knowledge of
the artists, was contrasted with the often-dry nature of subsequent art
historical texts. The author highlights the importance of figures like
Leo Anisov, whose books, like Fedorov-Davydov’s, offer a rich and
detailed exploration of Russian artists and their context, particularly
through accounts of individuals like Pavel Tretyakov, revealing the
intellectual and social circles surrounding them. The text emphasizes
the relative neglect of these great artists in contemporary exhibitions
and publications, and praises Anisov’s work for its depth and insight.

PUTIN’S EXIT OR A PEACEFUL REVOLUTION AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A BLOOD
REVOLUTION
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-05-18 - <b> Stanislav Belkovskiy </b>
</p>
<p>

This text argues that Russia is on the brink of a revolution, not due to
external forces, but due to the internal failings of the ruling elite –
specifically, the “club-175” of key figures surrounding President Putin.
The core issue is a fundamental disconnect between the leadership and
the Russian people, stemming from a lack of understanding of national
priorities and a reliance on outdated, ineffective political
technologies.

The author contends that the 2004 Ukrainian election, which exposed the
flaws in Putin’s approach to power, was a pivotal moment. The failure to
understand the importance of popular support and the need for a genuine
national leader led to a loss of control and a growing sense of panic
within the Kremlin.

The proposed solution is a “peaceful revolution” – a managed transition
of power to a new national elite, rather than a chaotic, destructive
revolution. This transition would occur when Putin voluntarily steps
down, likely in the spring or summer of 2007, and is facilitated by the
formation of a credible alternative political force. The text emphasizes
that the key to preventing a full-blown revolution lies in addressing
the fundamental flaws within the current leadership and establishing a
new national identity focused on preserving Russia as a stable,
functioning state. The author believes the current leadership is
incapable of achieving this and that a managed transition is the only
viable path forward.

<p>
Belarus began exploring opportunities with the Arab world in 1992,
initially due to a vacuum created by the collapse of Soviet ties. This
was driven by a dual motivation: a need to diversify exports from its
heavily industrialized economy, particularly from major manufacturers
like MTZ, BelAZ, and MАЗ, and a desire for investment to modernize its
industrial base. The political climate, including a multi-vector foreign
policy and ideological alignment with Arab leaders regarding a
multi-polar world, further encouraged these efforts. Key economic
partnerships developed with countries in the Persian Gulf, including
reconstruction projects and military-technical cooperation, leading to
increased trade and recognition of Belarus as an independent state
within the Arab community. The relationship continues to grow in
importance for Belarus, with Arab nations becoming a vital economic and
political partner.

This text is a passionate and critical defense of Mikhail Sholokhov and
his novel, “The Quiet Don.” The author argues that Sholokhov is a
national hero, unjustly maligned by those who dislike his portrayal of
Cossack life and values. He contends that Sholokhov’s work represents a
profound understanding of Russian history and character, particularly
through the figure of Grigory Melekhov. The author expresses frustration
with the perceived attempts to discredit Sholokhov, attributing this to
a general disdain for strong, independent figures and a preference for
ideological conformity. He highlights the novel’s enduring significance
as a national epic, emphasizing its themes of loyalty, courage, and the
enduring spirit of the Russian people. The author views Sholokhov’s work
as a vital counterpoint to those who seek to diminish Russia’s rich
cultural heritage. He concludes by asserting Sholokhov’s continued
relevance as a symbol of Russian national identity and a defender of

2005-05-25 - <b> Ruslan Bychkov </b>
</p>
<p>
The text explores the concept of “barbarians” as a potential force for
renewal in the 21st century, drawing on Nietzsche’s prophecy about a
“barbarian” resurgence following societal collapse. Initially, the
“barbarians” are seen as representing the conservative movements
emerging in Europe after World War I and the Russian Revolution.
However, the analysis extends to contemporary Russia, portraying it as a
nation “rotting” and increasingly aligned with the West, yet still
possessing the potential to become a new, disruptive force. The author
argues that these “barbarians” – those who actively dismantle existing
structures – are not inherently negative, but rather represent a
necessary process of radical change. Drawing on Walter Benjamin’s
interpretation of “barbarism” as a positive force for innovation, the
text suggests that these individuals, seeing “paths” where others see
walls, are crucial for reshaping society. The ultimate goal is the
rejuvenation of Russia and, potentially, the world, through the actions
of these new “barbarians” who actively seek to dismantle the old order.

SUDAN AND RUSSIA: THE PATH TO DIALOGUE

</p>
<p>

This text expresses deep concern regarding the deteriorating
relationship between Russia and the Arab world, particularly Sudan,
following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The author argues that
Russia’s foreign policy has been overly negative, fueled by a biased
narrative centered around “terrorism” and a deliberate distortion of
reality. He criticizes the portrayal of Arab nations as threats and
accuses the United States and Israel of manipulating the situation to
maintain global dominance.

The core argument is that Russia’s strategic interests in the Middle
East are being undermined by a misguided approach that fosters distrust
and ignores valuable partnerships. The author laments the lack of
genuine engagement with Sudan, highlighting missed opportunities for
economic and cultural collaboration. He expresses frustration with the
perceived prioritization of Western interests over Russia’s
relationships with key Arab allies.

Ultimately, the text calls for a more proactive and supportive Russian
policy towards the Arab world, emphasizing the importance of mutual
respect, genuine partnership, and a rejection of biased narratives. It
paints a picture of a missed opportunity for Russia to maintain a
crucial strategic position in a volatile region.

    </p>
    <p>
    This text outlines a radical vision for Russia’s economic and
    political future, centered around correcting perceived failures of
    the current system and establishing a more secure and prosperous
    nation. It argues that the existing “free market” is ineffective
    without ensuring national reproduction and historical continuity,
    and that the country’s vast, resource-rich territory and harsh
    climate necessitate a strong, centralized state focused on
    population growth and strategic development.

The core proposals involve a decisive rejection of Western liberal
models, emphasizing state control over key sectors like energy, defense,
and technology. A key element is combating corruption and oligarchy
through strict state oversight, including a new anti-corruption agency
with broad investigative powers.

Economically, the text advocates for a return to state-led
industrialization, prioritizing investment in strategic industries like
machine building and energy, alongside a deliberate policy of
protectionism to foster domestic production and limit foreign influence.
It calls for a significant reduction in the size and scope of the
government bureaucracy and a shift in focus away from Western
consumerism towards national self-sufficiency and a population growth
strategy. The text frames this as a necessary “operation” to dismantle
the current system and establish a truly national and prosperous Russia.

    This text is a darkly satirical critique of Russian politics and
    society, presented as a series of observations and accusations. It
    argues that a corrupt and increasingly authoritarian
    “military-patriotic power” has infiltrated all aspects of life, from
    schools to the justice system. The narrative suggests that this
    power, driven by a desire for control and fueled by a distorted
    sense of national security, actively creates and exploits crises –
    like the Beslan school siege – to consolidate its authority.

The author highlights a cycle of manipulation, where the government uses
staged events to justify increased surveillance, repression, and the
erosion of civil liberties. The story portrays a system where
individuals like Lyuba, a seemingly ordinary woman, become unwitting
pawns in this scheme, falsely accused and punished for actions
orchestrated by the state.

The text expresses deep cynicism about the legal system, suggesting it
is a tool of control rather than justice. It also points to a broader,
more unsettling connection between the government’s actions and the rise
of terrorism, implying that the state itself is responsible for creating
the conditions that lead to such tragedies. The overall tone is one of
bleak disillusionment and a warning about the dangers of unchecked power
and the manipulation of public opinion.

This text details a protracted legal battle involving Admiral A. Bukin
and rights activists E. Vilenksy and E. Polyakov against the Nakhimov
Naval School in Petersburg, Russia. The core of the dispute revolves
around accusations made by these activists, through the “Soldiers’
Mothers” organization, that the school engaged in abusive and morally
corrupt practices, including allegations of Nazi symbols, violence, and
psychological harm inflicted on the 700 students.

The legal proceedings have been repeatedly delayed and hampered by the

presented questionable documents, many lacking proper verification, and
fabricated claims of abuse, including claims of Nazi symbols, physical
violence, and psychological torment. The legal team representing Admiral
Bukin, through his lawyer, Antonov, strongly refuted these accusations,
pointing out the lack of evidence, the questionable origins of the
documents, and the history of fabricated claims made by the activists.
The case has been marked by a chaotic and contentious legal process,
with numerous attempts to stall the proceedings and discredit the
school. The legal team highlighted the activists’ history of making
false claims and the lack of credible evidence supporting their
accusations.

Russia’s relationship with the West and its internal political dynamics.
It details a strategy of distraction – creating “smoke screens” and
manipulating perceptions – to maintain control and influence.

Key elements include:

-   **Domestic Political Games:** The text describes a deliberate
    attempt to create divisions within Russia’s leadership (“the

-   **Western Relations:** Russia is portrayed as actively seeking to
    appease Western business interests (City Group, German elites)
    through promises of increased energy exports, while simultaneously
    engaging in a complex dance of diplomacy and strategic ambiguity.
    There’s a concern about Western influence and a desire to leverage

-   **Geopolitical Considerations:** The text highlights Russia’s
    strategic calculations regarding the Middle East, particularly the
    rise of Iran and its potential impact on global energy routes and

-   **Control and Manipulation:** The overall narrative suggests a

    authority and influence international relations.

Essentially, the text depicts a Russia attempting to manage its

<p>

This text analyzes Vladimir Putin’s political maneuvering following the
G8 summit in Glenagles, suggesting a complex and ultimately precarious
strategy. Putin was attempting to assert himself on the global stage,
fueled by perceived grievances against the West, particularly regarding
“prestige” and influence. He employed a tactic of aggressive displays –
including a blitz tour of Dagestan, pronouncements about controlling the
Caucasus, and attempts to undermine Western interests in the Caspian Sea
and surrounding regions – alongside a calculated effort to appear as an
equal to “world leaders.”

However, the text argues this strategy was largely performative and
ultimately unsustainable. Putin’s actions were driven by a desire to
maintain power, not by genuine strategic advantage, and were accompanied
by a history of escalating rhetoric followed by significant concessions.
The author highlights a growing disconnect between Putin’s self-image as
a “legitimate heir” and the reality of mounting external pressure.

The text suggests that despite the West’s antagonism, Putin’s survival

</p>
<p>
This text is an introduction to a book by Nikolai Anisin titled “We Were
Given Democracy…” It details Anisin’s career as a journalist, starting
with his work for the Soviet newspaper “Pravda” and his subsequent shift
to more critical publications like “Den” and “Zavtra,” reflecting his
growing disillusionment with the policies of Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris
Yeltsin. The book is presented as a critical examination of the events
leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of
Western-influenced reforms. Anisin argues that his work exposes the
hidden motivations behind political decisions and offers a perspective
on the consequences of “democracy” for Russia. The text concludes with
information about purchasing the book.

ANTI-ELITE - A CURSE FOR RUSSIA
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-08-09 - <b> Sergey Telegin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text argues that the current political situation in Russia is dire
due to a breakdown in the opposition, specifically the left-patriotic
movement. It identifies a key problem: the failure to build effective
alliances and a shared national project. The author contends that a
series of missteps, including infighting, a lack of strategic planning,
and a reliance on divisive tactics, have weakened the opposition and
left it vulnerable to manipulation by the ruling power.

The core argument is that a revitalized left-patriotic movement needs to
immediately establish a formal agreement – a “non-aggression pact” –
with other opposition groups, coupled with a unified approach to the
upcoming elections. This would involve a coordinated effort to monitor
the election process, prevent fraud, and ultimately, to present a
single, credible candidate for president.

The author expresses concern that without such immediate action, Russia
risks a “colored revolution” and the further decline of the nation. They
believe that a renewed focus on building a broad, inclusive national
project is essential to restore stability and prevent a catastrophic
outcome. The text emphasizes the need for strategic planning, coalition
building, and a unified front to overcome the current political crisis.

2005-08-16 - <b> Aleksandr Prokhanov </b>
</p>
<p>
This text frames the upcoming Latvia-Russia football match as a deeply
symbolic and politically charged event, far exceeding a simple sporting
contest. It portrays the game as a manifestation of historical
grievances, nationalistic ambitions, and deep-seated animosities between
the two nations. The match is seen as a proxy war, fueled by historical
traumas like the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and Stalin’s comparison to
Hitler. Russia is depicted as a wounded, directionless giant, while
Latvia is portrayed as a defiant, vengeful nation seeking retribution.
The text suggests that the game will unleash powerful, uncontrollable
national energies, analyzed by social psychologists and observed by
various groups with vested interests. Ultimately, the author argues that
Russia’s true victory lies not in a football win, but in reclaiming its
national identity and historical narrative, a victory that will be
evident in broader societal achievements. The text concludes with a
cautionary note, advising restraint and a somber acceptance of defeat if
Latvia wins, emphasizing that the true victory for Russia will be a far
greater one.

This text presents a series of interconnected geopolitical and domestic
Russian concerns, largely framed through a critical and somewhat
conspiratorial lens. It suggests a rapidly deteriorating situation
within Russia, characterized by instability, potential military
escalation (particularly involving Iran), and a weakening leadership
under Vladimir Putin. Key themes include:

-   **Military Instability & Potential Conflict:** Fears of a US-Iran
    conflict are prominent, fueled by perceived Iranian mobilization
    plans and the chaos within Russia’s defense industry, highlighted by
    the “Prize” mini-submarine incident and concerns about leadership
    within the armed forces.
-   **Domestic Political Crisis:** The text depicts a fracturing within
    the Russian government, with “siloviki” (security officials) vying
    for power, undermining Putin’s authority, and creating a volatile
    political landscape. This is reflected in upcoming elections,
    internal power struggles, and accusations of corruption.
-   **External Interference & Shifting Alliances:** The text suggests
    significant external influence, particularly from the US, through
    strategic maneuvering with Iran, and through attempts to destabilize
    Russia. It also highlights concerns about China’s growing influence
    and the impact of European political developments (particularly
    regarding the German elections).
-   **Conspiracy Theories & Negative Assessments:** The text frequently
    employs a critical tone, portraying Putin’s leadership as weak and
    vulnerable, and suggesting a deliberate manipulation of events by
    external actors. It references “siloviki” as a dominant force and
    uses terms like “petrovsk полков” (Petrovsk regiments) to imply a
    lack of competence.

Overall, the text paints a picture of a Russia facing multiple crises,
with significant implications for international relations and a
potentially unstable future.

NATIONALIST FAITH. End. Beginning in #33
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2005-08-23 - <b> Yegor Kholmogorov </b>
</p>
<p>

The text outlines the core tenets of Russian nationalism, arguing it’s
about a nation’s right to exist and thrive independently, free from
external pressures or justifications. It posits that Russia shouldn’t
define itself by the needs of the world (like Europe or the US) but
rather by its own national goals: building a unique civilization and
ensuring its enduring sovereignty.

The text emphasizes a “self-determining” approach, rejecting imposed
missions or identities. It criticizes those who demand Russia fulfill a
global role, viewing this as a form of self-denial.

Furthermore, it frames nationalism as a protective force, safeguarding
Russia’s right to exist and develop its own distinct cultural and
economic path, prioritizing national interests above all else. The
author suggests that Russian nationalism is a reaction to perceived
threats from globalization and the demands of the international
community, aiming to preserve Russia’s unique identity and future.

Dmitry Rogozin, leader of the “Rodina” party, argues that Russian
nationalism is a reaction to the disunity of the Russian people and the
perceived humiliation of the nation. He believes the Russian national
idea centers on responsibility for preserving Russia’s diverse culture
and state, not superiority. Rogozin attributes rising nationalism to the
breakdown of the country and the negative feelings of the Russian
people. He views the national question as primarily a matter of power
and criticizes the “United Russia” party for attempting to discredit
“Rodina” and accusing it of seeking popularity and political power.
Rogozin emphasizes that “Rodina” has no ties to the Yukos empire and
denies accusations of funding from similar sources. He advocates for
strengthening inter-ethnic relations and promoting Russian culture to
address perceived issues of national pride and historical perspective.

<p>

The text recounts recollections of Artyom Sergeyev about Stalin’s
dachas, particularly the Volynskoye estate. Initially, Stalin’s primary
dacha was in Zubalovo, followed by Volynskoye, and previously,
Sookolovka. These were not permanent residences but rather temporary
places to stay, similar to hotels. The text details a visit to
Volynskoye in 1934, where Stalin established it as his main residence.

Stalin’s Volynskoye dacha was built specifically for him, designed by
architect Merzonov, and featured a two-story brick house, initially
painted green. It included a dining room, a study, a kitchen, and a
veranda where Stalin often worked, drinking “Borjomi” and smoking a
pipe. The estate was meticulously organized, with a focus on order and
efficiency, reflecting Stalin’s personality.

Stalin’s daily routine involved working on a tidy desk, consuming
“Borjomi” and smoking a pipe, and maintaining a disciplined approach to
his work. He was known for his measured movements and reserved gestures.
The estate was staffed by a small team, including a cook, a
groundskeeper, and a security detail, who ensured a controlled
environment.

Ultimately, Stalin died at the Volynskoye dacha, and the estate was
subsequently closed. The text highlights the significance of these
dachas as places where Stalin conducted business and maintained a
semblance of normalcy amidst the pressures of his leadership.

The text critiques the renaming of two major Minsk avenues, Prospekt
Skoriny and Prospekt Masherova, by President Lukashenko. Initially
justified as a response to demands from nationalists regarding
“independence,” the move was widely seen as a manipulative tactic to
appease the opposition, particularly given the existing streets still
bearing names associated with communist figures. The author highlights
the absurdity of the situation, emphasizing that the renaming was
financially wasteful (15,000 dollars) and symbolically jarring,
particularly with new street signs painted in the colors of the wartime
collaborationist flag. The author argues that the move was politically
motivated, intended to create confusion and potentially destabilize the
situation ahead of upcoming elections, and that the public reaction,
including protests and concerns about a potential return to nationalist
symbols, demonstrates the public’s distrust of the president’s motives.

John Sibruka’s “Nobrow: Marketing of Culture” explores the evolving
relationship between culture and marketing, particularly focusing on the
shift in American cultural values. The book examines how the
once-dominant “highbrow” culture, represented by publications like *The
New Yorker*, lost ground to a “nowbrow” culture driven by trends and
commercial success. Sibruka traces this change through the history of
*The New Yorker*, highlighting how the magazine’s shift in editorial
policy under editor Tina Brown led to a greater emphasis on popular
culture and trends, effectively merging marketing and culture. The core
argument is that culture has increasingly become a commodity, shaped and
manipulated by marketing forces. Sibruka uses the example of *The New
Yorker*’s transformation to illustrate how cultural hierarchies are
fluid and determined by market demand, rather than inherent artistic
merit. Ultimately, the book presents a diagnosis of contemporary culture
– a state where marketing and culture are inextricably linked, with
“nowbrow” dominating the landscape.

This text is a commentary on recent events involving Mikhail
Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, focusing on their experiences in
Russian prisons and the broader political context. The author, a former
convict himself, uses a conversational and somewhat rambling style,
drawing parallels to historical figures like Dostoyevsky and those
executed on the gallows to illustrate the transformative potential of
imprisonment.

The core argument is that Khodorkovsky’s recent hunger strike,
orchestrated by Lebedev, represents a genuine shift in perspective,
moving beyond oligarchic pride towards a deeper understanding of the
Russian people’s struggles. The author emphasizes the importance of
trusting information gleaned from prison sources, highlighting the
reliability of “prison talk.” He criticizes the authorities’ actions,
particularly the denial of Lebedev’s access to court documents, viewing
it as a deliberate attempt to stifle Khodorkovsky’s evolving
understanding. The author concludes with a hopeful assessment of
Khodorkovsky’s potential transformation, suggesting that the experience
of incarceration can fundamentally alter a person’s worldview.

“Зазеркалье” is a significant, albeit short-lived, rock band from the
late 1980s in Rostov, USSR, known for its rebellious and unconventional
ideas. The band’s album, “Власть судьбы,” is a complex and
historically-influenced work, reflecting a sense of disillusionment and
searching for meaning in a restrictive society. The band’s story is
marked by sudden disbandments and reunions, driven by the leader, Oleg
Gaponov’s, desire to return to his roots. The current lineup, formed by
chance, aims to revive the band’s original spirit. The band’s sound is
described as eclectic, drawing from various influences including Russian
classics, and aiming for a raw, authentic aesthetic. They are viewed as
representing a genuine, anti-establishment voice, contrasting with what
is perceived as a superficial and commercialized “underground” scene.
The band’s legacy is one of cultural resistance and a commitment to

This text is a scathing critique of contemporary Russia, arguing that
despite economic “reforms” and increased wealth, the country is deeply
flawed. The author expresses frustration with the dominance of a small
elite, the lack of genuine progress, and the perpetuation of a system
that prioritizes profit over the well-being of the population.

The core argument is that the “reforms” implemented since the fall of
the Soviet Union have not led to a truly prosperous and equitable
society. Instead, the country is characterized by a concentration of
wealth in the hands of a few, a disregard for social issues like poverty
and inequality, and a reliance on superficial metrics like rankings in
publications like Forbes.

The author laments the lack of respect for traditional values, the
decline in cultural standards, and the overall sense of disillusionment.
They point to the success of athletes and entertainers in Forbes
rankings as a symbol of this distorted system, arguing that genuine
talent and hard work are not being recognized.

Ultimately, the text is a pessimistic assessment of Russia’s trajectory,
suggesting that unless fundamental changes are made—specifically, a
renewed emphasis on social responsibility, respect for human dignity,
and a rejection of the prevailing “reforms”—the country is headed for a
similar fate to ancient civilizations like Sodom and Gomorrah. The

This text is a scathing critique of President Putin’s televised
responses to questions about the state of Russian education. The core
argument is that Putin’s answers were a carefully crafted, superficial
attempt at a “social handout” rather than a genuine commitment to
improving the system.

The responses focused on small, incremental benefits – increased teacher
bonuses, small grants for schools and students, and vague promises about
reforms like a new pay system based on “quality of teaching” (without
defining how this would be measured). Crucially, Putin avoided
addressing fundamental issues such as inadequate school funding based on
student numbers, the detrimental effects of the ЕГЭ exam, the ongoing
privatization of universities, or the “brain drain” of graduates.

He presented a distorted picture of the situation, emphasizing the
“demand” for Russian specialists and promoting the creation of
“technico-innovative zones” with high salaries – setting a target of
30,000 rubles per month for young scientists. The overall impression is
that Putin’s approach is short-sighted, lacking a strategic vision for
Russian education’s future, and prioritizing superficial gestures over

This text presents a series of interconnected geopolitical and domestic
developments primarily focused on Russia’s strategic maneuvering and the
shifting dynamics within Europe. Key themes include:

-   **Russia’s Constitutional Shift:** The sale of Sibneft to Gazprom is
    portrayed as a deliberate move towards a constitutional reform,
    consolidating presidential power, expanding regional autonomy, and
    potentially leading to a referendum with a guaranteed positive
    outcome.
-   **US Strategic Interests:** The “Delimitation” of Russia is seen as
    a US effort to maintain its global influence, particularly through
    controlling energy transit and fueled by concerns surrounding the
    “Karimov case” and similar human rights investigations in other
    countries.
-   **Ukraine’s Political Maneuvering:** Yuriy Yekhanurov’s visit to
    Moscow, coinciding with Viktor Yushchenko’s daughter’s wedding, is
    presented as a strategic move by Yushchenko to secure energy transit
    routes and potentially influence Ukraine’s political trajectory,
    with Yushchenko effectively acting as a “second seller.”
-   **European Dynamics:** The failed negotiations regarding Turkey were
    initiated from Berlin to avoid direct confrontation with the large
    Turkish community in Austria, while the “Karimov case” and similar
    investigations are seen as a broader effort to exert pressure on
    Russia.
-   **Domestic Russian Politics:** The appointments of Alexander Shokhin
    and “right-leaning” governors are interpreted as a continuation of a
    “pro-Western, liberal” economic policy, alongside a shift towards a
    more conservative and security-focused elite.

    Following the resignation of Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine’s political
    landscape remains unstable with significant “debris” and “blocks”
    continuing to fall unexpectedly. Viktor Yushchenko, seeking support
    for his “orange ideals,” pledged Western benefits, criticized
    opponents, and sought to unify the West and East, driven by the
    upcoming elections. However, his efforts haven’t gained significant
    traction due to limited financial support and ongoing criticism. The
    attempted sale of “Kryvorizhstal” is hampered by logistical
    challenges.

Furthermore, the “Hongadze” case (referring to the death of journalist
Giorgi Gongadze) and the involvement of Sergei Gulovatyy, formerly
Tymoshenko’s justice minister, continue to fuel controversy, with
accusations implicating Prosecutor General Slyuschenko. Tymoshenko’s
team plans to use this to discredit the current government, potentially
through show trials.

Yulia Tymoshenko’s actions, including her wedding to a British rock
musician and her choice of the Kyiv Patriarchate (a controversial,
unrecognized Orthodox church), are strategically employed to bolster her
image and appeal to a broad range of voters. The involvement of former
PM Pavel Lazarenko, currently imprisoned in the US, and his potential
participation in the elections, adds another layer of uncertainty.
Yushchenko’s political future is highly uncertain, and his survival
depends on a difficult and unpredictable struggle.

Станислав Белковский’s interview, conducted by Vladimir Vinnikov, offers
a pessimistic assessment of the political situation in Ukraine following
the September coup that ousted Prime Minister Tymoshenko. He believes
the country is characterized by three distinct, unresolved entities – a
pro-Western, pro-NATO bloc led by Yushchenko, a pro-Russian bloc led by
Tymoshenko, and a third, largely apathetic bloc centered in the Donbas
region.

Belkovsky argues that neither Yushchenko nor Tymoshenko truly represent
a strong, unified Ukrainian identity. He sees Tymoshenko as the more
likely victor in upcoming parliamentary elections, largely due to her
appeal to social justice ideals and her ability to leverage the
discontent stemming from the economic hardship and the legacy of the
Maidan Revolution.

Crucially, he believes both sides will continue to seek support from
external actors, particularly Russia, driven by self-interest rather
than genuine geopolitical concerns. He predicts that Russia will support
both sides, primarily to protect its economic interests and maintain
influence over the Donbas region. Belkovsky expresses skepticism that
either side will prioritize the well-being of the Russian-speaking
population or address broader geopolitical issues. He views the
Ukrainian political elite as adept at manipulating external support for
their own benefit, suggesting a cycle of dependence and exploitation.

PRESIDENT’S CAMOUFLAGE

<p>
2005-10-25 - <b> Mikhail Delyagin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a critical analysis of the 2006 Russian federal budget,
delivered by economist Mikhail Delyagin. Delyagin argues that the budget
is fundamentally flawed and driven by political considerations rather
than sound economic planning. He believes the budget’s projections –
particularly concerning economic growth, inflation, and oil prices – are
overly optimistic and unrealistic.

Specifically, Delyagin criticizes the government’s assumption of a 5.8%
GDP growth rate, arguing that this is based on an unrealistic drop in
oil prices (from $48 to $40 per barrel) and ignores the long-term global
implications of resource depletion. He also expresses skepticism about
the projected 7% inflation rate for 2006, suggesting it’s based on
manipulated statistics.

Delyagin views the budget as a political tool, designed to create the
illusion of economic progress ahead of anticipated 2006 elections. He
highlights the disconnect between the government’s stated goals and its
actual actions, pointing out that the budget prioritizes political
expediency over genuine economic reform. He expresses concern that the
budget’s focus on boosting public sector salaries and maintaining a
facade of economic prosperity will ultimately exacerbate social and
economic inequalities and fail to address Russia’s underlying economic
challenges. He concludes that the entire budget is a deliberate
deception aimed at manipulating public opinion.

continued influence and the need to eventually distance themselves, the
opposition remains deeply critical of Russia, frequently using
nationalist rhetoric and rejecting Russian language. Key figures, like
the “unified” candidate Milinkevich, are attempting to avoid
antagonizing Russia while seeking Western support and aiming to exploit
the potential for Western influence. The opposition’s strategy involves
carefully navigating between Russia and the West, prioritizing
maintaining access to the Russian market while ultimately seeking

The author, a participant, describes a significant and unexpected surge
in attendance, estimating between 5,000 and 10,000 people, primarily
drawn by the banners and slogans of the Movement Against Illegal
Immigration (DPI). He emphasizes the rapid growth of DPI into a

The author highlights the diverse range of organizations involved,
including the Communist Party of Russia (KPRF) and other patriotic
groups, noting the KPRF’s participation and the surprisingly positive
response to the march’s slogans. He details a significant portion of the
public’s support for the march’s message, as evidenced by a radio poll

sow discord to maintain their grip on power. The narrative utilizes

This text outlines the “Rodina” Party’s platform for Moscow, centered
around combating corruption, addressing social inequalities, and
restoring control of the city to its residents. The party criticizes the
current administration’s alleged manipulation of the city’s finances,
particularly through the exploitation of a “capital rent” derived from
land and property, which is instead funneled to a corrupt elite.

Key demands include: implementing a transparent system for utilizing
city assets, taxing luxury goods and foreign workers to increase
revenue, and strictly regulating the influx of migrant labor to protect
local jobs and prevent criminal activity. The party argues that the
current system unfairly disadvantages Moscow residents and seeks to
establish a more equitable distribution of the city’s wealth. They
propose a comprehensive social package, including guaranteed employment,
affordable housing, and improved social services, all funded by
addressing the systemic corruption they identify. Ultimately, the
“Rodina” Party positions itself as a champion for the ordinary Moscow
citizen against a corrupt and out-of-touch government.

2005-11-15 - <b> Yevgeniy Levshin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a cynical and critical examination of the Russian system of
forensic psychiatry. It argues that the system is fundamentally
political and serves to reinforce the existing power structures rather
than provide a fair assessment of mental illness. The author highlights
the lack of independent oversight, the tendency to label individuals as
“insane” to avoid prosecution, and the influence of political
considerations over medical judgment.

The piece uses a series of anecdotes – including the author’s own
experience being questioned by a psychiatrist, the story of an elderly
man wrongly committed to a mental institution, and the case of a woman
who was deemed mentally unstable after being beaten by her neighbor – to
illustrate these points. The author contends that the system is
characterized by a disregard for individual rights and a reliance on
subjective assessments, often driven by a desire to maintain order and
control.

Ultimately, the text expresses a deep skepticism about the role of
forensic psychiatry in Russia, portraying it as a tool of oppression
rather than a mechanism for justice. It suggests that the system is
driven by a desire to maintain the status quo and that genuine mental
health concerns are often ignored in favor of political expediency.

This text argues that Vladimir Putin’s primary goal is the legal
transfer of $70 billion to a select group of private individuals. It
posits that Putin’s actions, including the withdrawal of Russian
military bases from Cuba and Vietnam, the decline in Russia’s
geopolitical influence in the former Soviet space, and his reluctance to
support allies like Georgia and Ukraine, are all driven by this
financial objective.

The author contends that Putin’s rhetoric about restoring Russia’s
imperial ambitions is a facade, designed to mask his true focus on
extracting wealth. He uses the example of Ukraine’s Viktor Yushchenko,
who sold the “Krivorozhstal” steel plant for a significantly higher
price than it was originally privatized for, highlighting the financial
motivations behind Putin’s decisions.

The text suggests that Putin’s actions are driven by a “business-genius”
approach, prioritizing personal financial gain over geopolitical
strategy. It concludes that Putin’s actions are essentially a
large-scale privatization scheme, with the ultimate goal of transferring
assets to a network of wealthy individuals, comparing Putin to a
“Всемогущий Воин” (All-Powerful Warrior) focused on personal wealth and
influence.

This text explores three potential models for future development: the
American (focused on consumerism and a “follower” role), the Japanese
(driven by technological innovation and a focus on “cognitive
evolution”), and the Russian model. The author argues that the Japanese
model, initially propelled by American science fiction, has been

collapse of the Soviet Union and a lack of a strong, visionary elite.

The text highlights the importance of science fiction and fantasy in
shaping a nation’s future, suggesting that Russia’s potential lies in
its existing, albeit underdeveloped, science fiction tradition and a
potentially disgruntled, educated population. It emphasizes that Russia

The text is a scathing critique of contemporary Russia, arguing that the
nation is stuck in a cycle of unproductive debate and distraction. It
contends that Russia suffers from a profound lack of collective purpose
and social cohesion, characterized by a fragmented public sphere
dominated by endless, often meaningless, controversies and ideological
skirmishes.

The author identifies several key issues contributing to this malaise: a
failure to mobilize the nation around significant goals, a deeply
divided and cynical public sphere fueled by manufactured outrage and
symbolic battles, and a pervasive sense of apathy and disillusionment
among the population.

Specifically, the text highlights the tendency for Russians to engage in
endless debates over historical figures, religious symbols, and
political ideologies, rather than focusing on addressing pressing social
and economic challenges. It suggests that this unproductive activity is
perpetuated by a political elite that prioritizes manipulating public
opinion over genuine engagement with the nation’s problems. The author
expresses concern that this situation will continue to prevent Russia
from achieving its full potential and ultimately leaves the nation

This text is a critical analysis of Sergei Ivanov’s appointment as
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, focusing on the potential impact on the
country’s defense sector and military capabilities. The author expresses
significant skepticism about Ivanov’s ability to address the deep-seated
problems within Russia’s military and defense industry.

The core argument is that Ivanov’s position, while seemingly intended to
bolster the defense sector, is actually exacerbating existing issues due
to the highly bureaucratic and inefficient structure of the government.
The author contends that the current system, largely shaped by previous
“reforms” led by Dmitry Kozak, has created a “bottleneck” within the
Federal Agency for Industrial and Civil Defense (FAP), which now
encompasses defense and civilian industries, hindering effective
management and modernization.

Specifically, the text criticizes the lack of a dedicated, professional
defense ministry, arguing that Ivanov’s role as a bureaucratic deputy
prime minister will not solve the fundamental problems of underfunding,
outdated equipment, and a lack of skilled personnel within the military
and defense industry. The author advocates for a return to a more
traditional structure with separate defense ministries, highlighting the
inefficiencies of the current system.

Furthermore, the text expresses concern about the potential for
continued “reforms” that further complicate the situation, urging a
focus on restoring a more effective organizational structure for
managing Russia’s defense capabilities. The author ultimately believes
that Ivanov’s appointment is unlikely to lead to meaningful improvements

are targeted by local officials seeking a percentage of investment
profits – often 20% – ostensibly for “city development,” but in reality,

investment in the local economy. The situation is further complicated by
a lack of transparency regarding where these funds are actually
