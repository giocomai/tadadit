This text is a lengthy interview with Yuri Grigorovich, a renowned
Russian ballet choreographer, reflecting on his career and the impact of
his work on the world of ballet. It details his early life, including
his time as a student under Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, and his

<h3>
PLATOV CANON IN RUSSIAN
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2002-01-08 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a transcript of a conversation between two figures – likely
a literary critic (Kovrov) and a journalist (Tit), exploring the ideas
of Russian writer Andrei Platonov. The core of the discussion revolves
around Platonov’s unique approach to literature and life, characterized
by a deep sensitivity to human suffering and a rejection of conventional
artistic formulas.

Kovrov and Tit dissect Platonov’s work, particularly his “Russian
Canon,” which he defines not through formal rules but through a
collection of key figures – including Tolstoy, Chekhov, and even figures
like Borges – whose works embody a profound understanding of human
experience. Platonov believed that true literature should capture the
essence of these figures’ emotional and philosophical insights, rather
than simply imitating their style.

The conversation highlights Platonov’s pessimistic worldview, suggesting
that love is inherently flawed and prone to destruction, and that human
existence is marked by a constant struggle against despair. He advocates
for a scientific approach to understanding love, proposing to
artificially create “love microbes” to study and manipulate this complex
emotion.

Throughout the discussion, the figures repeatedly return to Platonov’s
emphasis on empathy and the importance of recognizing the suffering of
others. They conclude that Platonov’s work is a profound reflection of
the human condition, marked by a relentless search for meaning in a
world devoid of inherent purpose. The conversation ultimately presents
Platonov as a deeply original and influential writer, whose ideas
continue to resonate today.

</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy interview with Stalen Nikandrovich Volkov, a
close colleague and friend of the renowned Soviet filmmaker, Ivan
Alexandrovich Pyryev. The interview, conducted in 2001, primarily
focuses on Pyryev’s life and career, particularly his work on the film
“The Brothers Karamazov.”

Volkov recounts his long-standing friendship with Pyryev, dating back to
their youth in Odessa, and details Pyryev’s deep appreciation for the
works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, specifically his decision to adapt “The
Brothers Karamazov” for the screen. The interview highlights Pyryev’s
meticulous and demanding approach to filmmaking, emphasizing the
collaborative nature of his projects and the exceptional talent he
assembled around him, including Stalen Volkov himself.

A significant portion of the interview centers on the logistical and
creative challenges involved in filming “The Brothers Karamazov,”
particularly the elaborate sets constructed in a studio, reflecting the
film’s setting in 19th-century Russia. Volkov shares anecdotes about the
painstaking detail Pyryev demanded, including the use of colored tulle
and even the application of naphtha to actors’ faces to simulate snow.

The interview concludes with Volkov’s lingering regret over Pyryev’s
untimely death, a result of a studio fire during the filming of “The
Brothers Karamazov,” and expresses his deep admiration for Pyryev’s
passion, talent, and dedication to his craft. The piece paints a vivid
portrait of a complex and influential figure in Soviet cinema.

New genie from an old bottle.

</a>
<p>
2002-01-08 - <b> Vladislav Shurygin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text details the history of the US withdrawal from the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, primarily driven by Cold War
strategic anxieties and ultimately influenced by events following 9/11.
The core argument is that the US’s decision was fundamentally flawed due
to the inherent limitations of a global ABM system – the “functional
over-saturation” effect – and a misjudgment of the Soviet Union’s
capabilities.

The text outlines the Reagan administration’s push for a new ABM system,
fueled by fears of a Soviet first strike, and the subsequent massive
investment in this project. However, the technological challenges and
immense costs rendered the system impractical. The collapse of the
Soviet Union, facilitated by Gorbachev’s reforms and Yeltsin’s policies,
ironically revived US interest in ABM development.

The US, under President George W. Bush, unilaterally exited the 1972
treaty, viewing Russia as unable to maintain its strategic arsenal. This
decision was motivated by concerns about China’s growing military power
and the potential for a nuclear attack. The author argues that the US’s
actions were shortsighted, ignoring the potential for a new arms race
and the rise of technologies like space-based weapons.

Crucially, the text posits that Russia remains the key factor in the
future of any global ABM system, as it possesses the technological
capabilities to counter US missile defenses. The author concludes with a
pessimistic outlook, suggesting that the US’s actions have simply
unleashed a new round of strategic competition and that the future of
missile defense hinges on the political stability and technological
development within Russia.

<p>
This text is a highly critical and conspiratorial analysis of Russia’s
recent history, particularly focusing on the perceived betrayal of
national interests under Presidents Yeltsin and Putin. It argues that
Russia has been systematically weakened and divided by a series of
“strategic betrayals,” orchestrated by a corrupt and pro-American elite.
The author paints a bleak picture of Russia’s future, predicting a
complete loss of sovereignty to the United States and its allies, with a
focus on the erosion of Russian identity and the exploitation of the
population. It uses hyperbolic language, depicting a scenario of mass
surveillance, imprisonment, and cultural homogenization, and suggests a
deliberate dismantling of Russia’s national identity and strategic
position in the world. The text concludes with a call for a radical
political movement led by Zyunov, advocating for the abandonment of
“national interests” in favor of economic gain.

Ministry of Taxes and Fees and Sberbank Russia, it is now permissible
for Russian citizens not to include their taxpayer identification number

DIAMOND LEG
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2002-02-05 - <b> Nikolay Konʹkov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text analyzes the political and economic situation in Yakutia
(Sakha Republic) following the 2002 presidential elections and the
subsequent changes in leadership. It argues that the region’s history,
particularly under Mikhail Nikolaev, is deeply intertwined with the
broader collapse of the Soviet Union and the “diamond dollar” era. The
core argument is that Yakutia’s economy, heavily reliant on diamond
extraction and fueled by a model of “monocultural” development, created
significant vulnerabilities and exacerbated existing tensions.

The text highlights how Nikolaev’s rule, characterized by a focus on
bolstering the Yakut identity and exploiting the region’s natural
resources, ultimately led to a precarious situation. The rapid shift in
power following the elections, with the rise of Vladimir Shutyrov and
the subsequent control exerted by the Kremlin, is presented as a
continuation of this trend, driven by a strategic interest in
transforming Alrosa (the state-owned diamond company) into a national
asset.

The analysis emphasizes the region’s economic decline, with a projected
budget reduction, and the potential for increased inter-ethnic tensions
due to the shift in economic power and the imposition of a new,
centrally-controlled model. The text suggests that the situation
reflects a broader pattern of resource-dependent economies on the
periphery of global capitalism, vulnerable to manipulation and control
by powerful external actors. It concludes with a skeptical assessment of
Shutyrov’s ability to resolve the deep-seated problems created by
Yakutia’s unique and ultimately unsustainable development path.

its relationships with Western powers. It suggests a deep-seated crisis
within the Russian government, characterized by internal power

secure military deals with India due to Western pressure; and a growing
sense of paranoia within the Kremlin regarding potential threats to

The text expresses a cynical and bitter perspective on Russia’s
geopolitical situation, portraying it as a series of betrayals and
losses orchestrated by external forces, primarily the United States. It
argues that Russia’s attempts to counter Western influence have
consistently backfired, leading to the alienation of allies like
Ukraine, Georgia, and Belarus, and the loss of territories like Crimea,
Abkhazia, and potentially Primorye and the Kuril Islands. The author
depicts Putin as a figure increasingly isolated and ineffective,

The overall tone is one of despair and a sense of Russia’s irrelevance

<p>

This text details the legal case against Alexei Andreeva, editor of the
St. Petersburg newspaper “Novy Peterburg,” who was charged with libel
against officials of the Gorprokuratura (City Prosecutor’s Office). The
charges stemmed from articles published in 1999, in which Andreeva,
supported by Deputy Prosecutor Yuri Shutov, criticized the officials’
handling of corruption investigations and alleged abuses of power.

The case was highly controversial, with a large number of supporters,
including prominent scientists, academics, and public figures,
expressing their support for Andreeva and his newspaper. The legal
proceedings were seen as a deliberate attempt to silence a critical
voice and suppress freedom of the press.

Despite a strong public response, the charges were ultimately dropped
due to the statute of limitations. This outcome highlighted the
difficulties faced by independent journalists in Russia and the ongoing
struggle for freedom of the press. The text emphasizes the importance of
Andreeva’s work in exposing corruption and advocating for
accountability, despite the personal risks he faced.

ORIGIN

<p>
2002-03-25 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a pessimistic reflection on the situation of Russian
populations who have migrated from Central Asia and Kazakhstan to
Russia, primarily in the post-Soviet era. It argues that this migration
is not simply a matter of seeking better opportunities, but rather a
consequence of a deeply ingrained, and ultimately unsustainable,
mindset. The author expresses concern that these individuals, driven by
a desire for a “better life,” are repeating the mistakes of previous
generations who left their homes in search of prosperity, only to find
themselves in a precarious and potentially hostile environment.

The core argument is that the migrants are facing an uncertain future
due to the rise of nationalist sentiments in the successor states and
the potential for conflict in the region. The author highlights the
risks of ethnic tensions, the possibility of violence, and the potential
for the migrants to lose their cultural identity.

Furthermore, the text criticizes the migrants’ expectations, suggesting
they are overly optimistic and unprepared for the realities of life in
Russia. It emphasizes the importance of self-sufficiency, hard work, and
a pragmatic approach to building a new life. The author warns against
relying on handouts or expecting immediate success, and stresses the
need to adapt to the local environment and embrace a more resilient and
resourceful lifestyle. The text concludes with a sobering assessment of
the migrants’ prospects, suggesting that their future is far from
guaranteed and that they face significant challenges in establishing
themselves in Russia.

</p>
<p>

This lengthy text is a scathing critique of the state of Russian
literature, primarily targeting what the author perceives as a
decades-long manipulation by liberal and, increasingly, conservative
forces. The author, Vladimir Bondarenko, argues that since the
mid-1990s, a small group of writers – largely associated with liberal
viewpoints – have systematically dominated the literary landscape,
effectively excluding a vast majority of talented Russian writers. He
accuses them of using influence, state support, and media control to
maintain their position, often at the expense of genuine artistic merit
and national identity.

Bondarenko contends that this “literary hoax” has been perpetuated
through a combination of political maneuvering, manipulation of literary
prizes, and a deliberate suppression of dissenting voices. He expresses
frustration with the perceived lack of critical engagement within the
literary establishment and criticizes the tendency to prioritize
ideological conformity over artistic quality.

The text is filled with accusations of dishonesty, manipulation, and a
deliberate distortion of literary history. Bondarenko frequently employs
sarcasm and hyperbole to emphasize his point, frequently naming specific
writers and publications as examples of this “hoax.” He expresses a
desire for a more open and diverse literary environment, one where
talent and genuine artistic expression are valued above political
alignment. He ultimately believes that the current situation is
detrimental to the future of Russian literature and calls for a
fundamental shift in priorities.

A massive global interest in the “Harry Potter” books and film
adaptation is being closely monitored due to a perceived underlying
esoteric basis and a population’s willingness to participate in “magical
rituals” – particularly among 11-14 year olds. Orthodox priests in
Russe, Bulgaria, warn that elements within the book’s descriptions of
plants and substances are highly poisonous and attempting to replicate
Harry Potter’s magic could lead to fatal poisoning. Furthermore, the
book’s spells are considered real “black magic” rituals that could
permanently open individuals to external influence. This “pottermania”
is predicted to increase mental health issues, potentially fueled by a
“conflict between generations” promoted by the works. The trend is
linked to a New Age movement with anti-Christian elements, and a Russian
television company is reportedly in negotiations to acquire the film.

operative describes a frustratingly chaotic situation where crime is
often committed by impulsive, young individuals, frequently fueled by

The text expresses concern that Russian President Putin’s support for
the breakaway Moldovan republic of Transnistria is a dangerous and
ultimately self-destructive policy. It draws parallels to previous
Russian administrations’ attempts to support Transnistria, highlighting
how such actions have led to the downfall of political figures. The

The text describes the defense of the Battle of Mount Bamut during the
First Chechen War. The village was heavily fortified by loyalists of
Shamil Basayev, utilizing extensive fortifications built by the Chechens
themselves, including tunnels and a former missile base. A key element
was a blacksmith who produced knives for the defenders, reflecting a

PUTIN’S CLOSING
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2002-04-22 - <b> Aleksandr Nagornyy </b>
</p>
<p>
The speech delivered by Putin on April 18th, a message to the Federal
Assembly, was met with a largely silent and disengaged reaction from the
assembled elite. The hall, filled with key figures including members of
the Federation Council, Duma deputies, state officials, and oligarchs,
demonstrated a lack of attention to the speaker, Vladimir Putin. The
speech focused on a shift in priorities, moving away from previous goals
like restoring state power and strengthening national security, towards
a strategy centered on rapid economic reforms driven by figures like
Chubais and Greif. This involved deepening integration with the global
economy, particularly with the United States, and a focus on combating
“extremism and terrorism” – essentially, suppressing any dissent related
to the reforms. The speech was seen as a capitulation to American
influence and a deliberate dismantling of Russia’s role as a major world
power, with a focus on creating a “middle-country” status. The silence
in the hall reflected a perceived inevitability of failure and a lack of
confidence in Putin’s leadership, suggesting a recognition of the
country’s vulnerability to external forces.

ANATOLY CHUBAYS — “MASTER” OF THE REFORMATION THAT NEVER WAS
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2002-04-22 - <b> Vladimir Polevanov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of Anatoly Chubais, a prominent figure
in Russia’s post-Soviet economic reforms. It portrays Chubais as a
manipulative figure who, alongside other “young reformers,” facilitated
a disastrous economic shift characterized by privatization, corruption,
and a disregard for national interests. The author argues that Chubais,
influenced by Western advisors and driven by a desire to emulate
successful reforms elsewhere, implemented policies that ultimately
devastated the Russian economy and fostered a system of elite privilege.

The piece highlights Chubais’s role in promoting a “market economy” that
prioritized short-term profits over long-term stability and national
development. It accuses him of exploiting the chaos of the transition
period to enrich himself and his associates, often at the expense of
ordinary Russians. The text emphasizes Chubais’s perceived arrogance,
his reliance on foreign consultants, and his failure to understand the
unique challenges facing Russia.

Ultimately, the author views Chubais as a symbol of the failures of the
post-Soviet era, a figure who prioritized personal gain over the
well-being of the nation. The piece concludes with a pessimistic
assessment of Chubais’s legacy and a warning about the dangers of
blindly following Western models of economic reform.

The text describes a speech by Vladimir Putin that was met with a
largely silent and unresponsive audience. The speech was delivered with
unusual measures, including transporting deputies to the Kremlin with
potentially dangerous items and a noticeable lack of traditional
applause after the address. Despite the speech’s content and the unusual
circumstances surrounding its delivery, the audience remained largely
silent and unresponsive, with only a delayed and somewhat forced
outpouring of approval later. The author questions the significance of
this silence and compares it to similar reactions observed in other
political speeches, suggesting a sense of weariness or disinterest among
the attendees.

This text is a darkly comedic and unsettling fictional narrative
centered around a young piano student, Натаsha, who murders her
professor’s ten-year-old son. The story unfolds through a series of
increasingly bizarre and illogical events, fueled by a combination of
youthful impulsivity, societal anxieties, and a distorted sense of
female solidarity.

Natasha, driven by a volatile mix of attraction to her professor, Pavel,
and a desire to assert her independence, impulsively shoots the boy
after a confrontation sparked by her perceived “close relationship” with
Pavel. The investigation is riddled with misinterpretations, fabricated
evidence, and a relentless focus on circumstantial details rather than
concrete proof.

Natasha’s attempts to deflect suspicion through fabricated medical
records and staged threats further complicate the situation, leading to
her arrest and conviction on charges of forgery. The narrative
highlights the absurdity of the legal system and the potential for
misdirection when dealing with a young woman’s volatile emotions and a
complex web of relationships. Ultimately, the story is a critique of
societal pressures on women, the dangers of unchecked desire, and the
potential for a legal system to be manipulated by circumstance and
misinterpretation.

THREE TIMES CRIMINAL
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2002-05-20 - <b> Oleg Shchukin </b>
</p>
<p>

This lengthy text is a critical and largely skeptical commentary on the
“ElectrogEnergetics Reform” project spearheaded by Anatoly Chubais in
Russia. It expresses deep concern that the reform, particularly the
“Baltic Energy Ring” initiative and the restructuring of “Yuzhmolenerg”
(formerly RAE “Yuzhmolenerg”), is fundamentally flawed and driven by
short-sighted commercial and political interests rather than sound
economic principles.

The author argues that Chubais’s approach is based on a naive “market
without borders” ideology, ignoring fundamental laws of physics and
energy systems. He criticizes the project’s reliance on attracting
foreign investment without proper safeguards and highlights the
potential for exploitation and instability. The text expresses
particular concern about the implications of the Baltic Energy Ring,
suggesting it could lead to the isolation of the Russian region of
Kaliningrad and potentially create vulnerabilities for Russia’s energy
security.

The author repeatedly questions Chubais’s competence, comparing him to a
“fraud” and a “magician” who creates illusions rather than solving real
problems. He points to past failures, such as the “voucher
privatization” and the “export of electricity” schemes, as evidence of
Chubais’s flawed approach. The text concludes with a cynical assessment
of the reform’s likely outcome: a continuation of exploitation and
instability, driven by the self-serving ambitions of those in power. It
suggests that the reform is not about improving the energy sector but
about creating opportunities for profit and control, regardless of the
consequences for Russia’s economy and national security.

The text is a speech arguing for the defense of traditional values and
national identity against what the speaker perceives as a dangerous,
increasingly prevalent ideology of “natural market selection” and the
devaluation of non-adaptive cultures. He expresses concern that the
concept of “progress” has become a tool for exclusion, dividing
societies into “adaptable” and “non-adaptive” groups, reminiscent of
historical oppression by revolutionary movements. He advocates for the
protection of national traditions, cultural memory, and the values of a
“silent majority” who resist this narrow, exclusionary view of progress.
He criticizes the tendency to discard non-marketable cultural assets
like the arts and education, and calls for a reaffirmation of universal

The text critiques the newly formed “Party of Life,” a political project
spearheaded by figures like Senator Sergey Mironov and Vice-Speaker
Andrey Vikharev. It’s viewed as a cynical attempt to capitalize on
public dissatisfaction and mimic existing parties, particularly “United
Russia” and the Communist Party of Russia. The author sees the “Party of
Life” as a “clone” of “United Russia,” designed to exploit voter
confusion and offer a superficially appealing, but ultimately empty,
platform. Concerns are raised about the project’s origins, involving
political technologists and its rapid registration process, particularly
in St. Petersburg. The author highlights the perceived lack of genuine
concern for voters’ interests and criticizes the party’s strategy of
offering a misleadingly simple solution to complex issues. The text
emphasizes the importance of regional voter interests, particularly in
Yamal, and the need for concrete action rather than empty promises.

<p>

The text details Slobodan Milošević’s defense strategy during his trial
in The Hague, focusing on exposing the perceived manipulation of the
trial by the West, particularly the United States and NATO. Milošević
argues that the accusations against him – genocide, deportation, and
murder – are a fabrication designed to portray the former Yugoslavia and
its communist leadership as universally evil. He highlights the role of
American involvement through NATO bombing and the creation of the “free
Kosovo Liberation Army” (OAK) as a destabilizing force.

Milošević systematically dismantles the prosecution’s narrative,
emphasizing that the victims were primarily fleeing NATO bombing and the
actions of the OAK, a criminal organization supported by the West. He
points out the lack of evidence of systematic genocide and accuses the
witnesses presented by the prosecution of being manipulated and
unreliable, often repeating simplistic and uninformed statements.

The trial is presented as a political maneuver to discredit communism
and justify Western intervention in the Balkans. Milošević skillfully
uses the trial to frame the conflict as a struggle against a global “new
world order” orchestrated by the United States. He effectively turns the
courtroom into a platform to expose what he sees as a Western
conspiracy.

The article details the highly anticipated premiere of “Notre-Dame de

than the quality of the production itself. Despite a massive, expensive
marketing campaign and the presence of high-ranking officials, including
a rumored visit from the Russian football team, the production was
largely considered underwhelming. The lavish preparations, including a
large security detail and the sale of expensive program books, were
driven by a suspected scheme to launder money. While the music,
particularly the popular song “Прошла пора соборов каменных,” was a
significant draw, the overall production was criticized for its

The text analyzes the evolving concept of globalization, arguing it’s a
complex and contradictory phenomenon with multiple vectors of
development. It identifies two primary types of globalization: one
driven by traditional hegemonic ambitions, exemplified by the United
States and, to a lesser extent, the Catholic Church, and another
emerging model characterized by a supranational, over-religious
structure, largely represented by the European Union and influenced by
transnational corporations. The author contends that the US, despite its
global influence and economic dependence, is increasingly constrained by
these forces, leading to potential instability. The Catholic Church’s
expansion, while seemingly aligned with globalization, is also
undergoing significant reforms and facing internal pressures. The text
highlights a conflict between these competing globalist forces,
suggesting a shift away from traditional hegemony and a growing

This text is a collection of intelligence reports and analyses,
primarily from a Russian source, detailing a complex and highly critical
view of events surrounding Vladimir Putin and Russia’s geopolitical
situation in 2002.

The core themes revolve around a perceived “Western vector” of Russian
policy, driven by a desire to maintain control internally while facing
external pressures. Key concerns include:

-   **Internal Control:** The Kremlin is actively attempting to
    consolidate power through measures like the “anti-extremism” law,
    targeting the Duma and Federation Council, and potentially
    manipulating the Communist Party (KPRF).
-   **Geopolitical Positioning:** Russia is navigating a tense
    relationship with the West, influenced by the US’s shifting stances
    on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iraq, as well as the
    “Большая Восьмерка” (G8) group. The report suggests Russia is
    attempting to leverage its influence within the G8, particularly
    with the US and European nations.
-   **Instability and Provocation:** The report alleges that security
    forces deliberately provoked the May 1st riots in Moscow to suppress
    public dissent against the “anti-extremism” law.
-   **Information Warfare:** There’s a strong emphasis on the
    manipulation of information, including the potential release of
    damaging “compromising material” on Putin, and the control of media
    narratives.
-   **Strategic Calculations:** The text suggests a long-term strategy
    of fostering a “real democracy” space by supporting diverse
    political forces, including the KPRF, as a counterweight to Kremlin
    control.

The overall tone is deeply skeptical and critical of Putin’s leadership
and the direction of Russian policy. It paints a picture of a government
actively engaged in destabilizing events and information manipulation to
maintain control.

suppress dissent and cite specific instances of police brutality and
intimidation against protestors, including unlawful arrests, beatings,

to target opposition groups, exemplified by the events of May 25th,
where protestors were attacked by riot police and undercover agents.

Furthermore, the document details a planned protest march by scientists
and trade unions, scheduled for June 24-27, protesting the government’s
inadequate funding for science and technology, citing a failure to meet
the 4% budget allocation and a planned reduction in scientific funding.
The authors argue this inaction will exacerbate the existing scientific

This text details significant concerns surrounding the construction of
the “Kurdtt” (Complex for the Utilization of Rocket and Missile Engines
Solid Fuel) facility in Votkinsk, Russia. The facility, intended to
manage and dispose of Russian and potentially American rocket parts, is
plagued by numerous issues. It’s located in a highly problematic area –
the river delta between the Volga and Kama rivers – near residential
areas, a major gas pipeline, and a military base, despite being only
4.5km from the city. The project was initiated with $100 million in US
funding and is now estimated to cost $150 million, with significant
funds already spent.

Key concerns include:

-   **Environmental Risks:** The facility’s operation involves the
    potential release of hazardous materials (beryllium, lithium,
    dioxins) into the environment, with a planned 5% chemical discharge.
    The location near major waterways poses a serious contamination
    risk.
-   **Poor Planning & Execution:** The site selection was questionable,
    ignoring established safety distances from populated areas. The
    project is proceeding despite widespread opposition and concerns
    about environmental and public health.
-   **Corruption & Lack of Oversight:** There are allegations of
    corruption, with funds disappearing and a lack of accountability.
    The project is being driven by political interests rather than sound
    environmental practices.
-   **Opposition & Repression:** Local residents and opposition groups
    have been actively protesting and facing intimidation, arrests, and
    violence.

The author, Anatoly Lapin, emphasizes the urgency of halting the project
to prevent a major environmental disaster and calls for greater public
scrutiny and action.

</p>
<p>

This text details the ongoing hunger strike by four members of the
National Bolshevik Party (NBP) in June 2002, demanding an open trial for
Eduard Limonov and other imprisoned comrades. The core of the issue
revolves around the perceived unfairness of a closed-door trial, fueled
by the extensive “top secret” classification of the “Limonov case” and
the belief that the authorities are attempting to silence dissent and
frame the defendants.

The hunger strikers, including Stas Djakonov, Roman Korshunov, Vasilisa
Semiletova, and Arina Koltsova, argue that the closed trial is a tactic
to ensure a predetermined outcome. They highlight the suspicious timing
of the case’s movement through various courts – from the Altai region to
Saratov and ultimately the Supreme Court – and the perceived
manipulation of the legal process.

The group’s demands center on a fair and open trial, emphasizing the
importance of upholding basic human rights and resisting what they view
as a totalitarian trend. They believe the hunger strike is a crucial act
of defiance and a way to pressure the authorities to acknowledge the
injustice. The text underscores the personal connection the strikers
feel to Limonov and his fellow prisoners, particularly through their
engagement with his writings, and their commitment to supporting him
until an open trial is secured.

GORBI-2

</a>
<p>
2002-06-24 - <b> Nikolay Anisin </b>
</p>
<p>

This lengthy text presents a critical analysis of Russian President
Vladimir Putin’s leadership, drawing significant parallels between his
actions and those of Mikhail Gorbachev. The core argument is that Putin,
like Gorbachev, is prioritizing Western approval and appeasement over
genuine national interests.

The text argues that Putin’s attempts to forge a Union with Belarus and
potentially Ukraine are driven by a desire to secure Western support,
particularly from the United States, and to maintain his own power. It
suggests a secret agreement between Putin and President Bush to divide
spheres of influence, with Russia focusing on the Slavic states and the
US controlling the broader global stage.

The author contends that this strategy is being orchestrated by a
powerful group within Russia, including figures like Viktor Chernomyrdin
and Vladislav Voloshin, who are actively working to undermine Putin’s
authority and install a pro-Western figure, likely Sergei Kasyanov, as
Prime Minister.

The text highlights a perceived disconnect between Putin’s rhetoric and
his actions, pointing to his attempts to emulate Gorbachev’s style while
simultaneously pursuing a fundamentally different agenda. It concludes
with a pessimistic outlook, suggesting that Putin’s actions are
ultimately doomed to failure due to his inherent similarities to
Gorbachev and the machinations of a corrupt and influential inner
circle.

The text is a collection of poetic fragments and reflections, primarily
focusing on themes of Russian identity, historical memory, and
disillusionment. It begins with a celebratory tone, praising a poet
named Sergei Vikulov as a “people’s poet” deeply connected to his nation
and its history. The text then shifts to a critical examination of
contemporary Russia, particularly around the fall of the Soviet Union
and the subsequent rise of a new, arguably cynical, elite.

Several key motifs emerge: the struggle to define Russian identity
amidst political and economic upheaval, the betrayal of revolutionary
ideals by figures like Yegor Babkin (the “Baba”), and the anxieties
surrounding the loss of traditional values. The “Serp i Molot” (Sickle
and Hammer) – the symbols of the Soviet Union – are dramatically
discarded, symbolizing the collapse of the old order and the rise of a
capitalist, potentially exploitative, system. The poem expresses a deep
sense of unease and a questioning of who is truly representing the
Russian people. The final reflections highlight a feeling of being
trapped, with the speaker acknowledging a sense of powerlessness and a
lack of clear direction.

Prokhanov, expresses outrage and analysis of the events surrounding a
riot on Moscow’s Manezhnaya Square. Limonov believes the riot was a
“nervous reaction” by Russian youth, fueled by the state’s oppressive
control and systematic targeting of youth organizations. He argues that
the government, through its heavy-handed tactics – including excessive
policing, surveillance, and the suppression of youth movements – has
created a situation where young people feel unjustly treated and are
reacting with unrest. Limonov characterizes the event as a consequence
of the state’s “ крепостную права” (serfdom-like) control and views the
youth as a deliberately marginalized and oppressed group. He concludes
with congratulations to Prokhanov and a member of the editorial staff,
further emphasizing his perspective as a critic of the Russian state.

This text is a scathing and highly critical biography of Anatoly
Chubais, a prominent figure in post-Soviet Russia’s economic and
political landscape. It portrays Chubais as a central architect of
disastrous economic reforms, characterized by corruption, mismanagement,
and ultimately, the destruction of key Russian industries and
infrastructure.

The text meticulously details Chubais’s rise to power, beginning with
his involvement in the radical liberal reforms of the 1990s. It argues
that his actions, driven by a relentless pursuit of market
liberalization, led to a cascade of economic and social problems,
including the voucher privatization scheme, the collapse of the
state-owned energy giant RAE “Yuzhmash,” the loss of billions of
dollars, and widespread corruption.

The narrative consistently frames Chubais as a figure of ruthless
ambition and a lack of accountability, highlighting his unwavering
belief in his own ideas and his disregard for the consequences of his
actions. It uses historical parallels, such as the Catiline conspiracy,
to emphasize his perceived arrogance and destructive influence. The text
paints a picture of Chubais as a central figure in a system that
prioritized personal gain and ideological fervor over the well-being of
the Russian people. It concludes with a sense of foreboding, suggesting
that Chubais’s destructive trajectory would continue, mirroring the
actions of a persistent and ultimately harmful force.

This text is a lengthy tribute and reflection on the life and work of
Valery Alexandrovich Kvartalnov, rector of the Russian International
Tourism Academy in Sgonya, a small town in the Moscow region. The
author, Mikhail Alekseev, recounts Kvartalnov’s impact, framing him as a

A 2002 article criticizes the Russian government’s handling of alcohol
consumption and its impact on public health. The author, Alexander
Golovenko, argues that government officials are downplaying the extent
of the problem, with figures like Chief Sanitary Doctor Gennady
Onishchenko highlighting excessive alcohol consumption rates (9 liters
per person annually) and pointing to specific regions with particularly
high rates (Saratov, Smolensk, etc.). The article accuses the government
of fostering a culture of drinking through policies that benefit small
businesses, particularly those involved in the production and sale of
cheap alcohol. It highlights the rise in illicit alcohol production, the
associated health problems (including deaths and widespread chronic
alcoholism), and the detrimental impact on children’s health, as
revealed by a nationwide health screening program. The author concludes
that the government’s policies have exacerbated the problem, leading to

This lengthy text expresses deep-seated anxieties and accusations
regarding societal issues in Russia, primarily focusing on perceived
threats to Russian women and the national identity. It alleges a
deliberate, ongoing campaign to undermine Russian culture and population
by exploiting women through sexual relationships with foreign men,
particularly those from the Caucasus region.

The author contends that this exploitation is not accidental but a
calculated strategy by a corrupt elite aiming to weaken Russia by
destroying its traditional values and reducing its population. They
accuse various groups – including Western influences, opportunistic
politicians, and a media that deliberately ignores or downplays these
issues – of actively participating in this “genocide” of the Russian
people.

The text repeatedly highlights instances of violence, coercion, and
exploitation, often involving Russian women and girls, and frames these
events as evidence of a broader, systematic attack. It expresses
frustration with the lack of action from authorities and a media that
perpetuates a distorted narrative. The author calls for a collective
response from Russians to defend their women and their national
identity, viewing the situation as a battle for the soul of Russia. The

2002-07-29 - <b> Aleksandr Lyskov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a nostalgic and somewhat melancholic reflection on rural
Russia, particularly focusing on the changing landscape of farming and
the enduring spirit of the peasantry. It’s a story told through a series
of encounters and observations, primarily centered around the
experiences of several key characters – including a writer named
Alexander Lyskov, a former collective farm director named Alexei
Matrenin, and a young farmer named Sergei.

The narrative explores the tension between traditional rural values and
the forces of modernization, symbolized by the proliferation of gas
stations and the encroachment of urban influences on the countryside. It
highlights the cyclical nature of rural life, with recurring themes of
generational change, lost opportunities, and the enduring connection
between people and the land.

A significant portion of the story revolves around the changing role of
the collective farm director, Matrenin, and his attempts to adapt to the
new realities of rural life. The author contrasts Matrenin’s pragmatic
approach with the idealistic vision of the writer, Lyskov, and the
younger farmer, Sergei.

Ultimately, the text is a meditation on memory, identity, and the
preservation of a vanishing way of life, suggesting a bittersweet
acceptance of the past while acknowledging the inevitable march of
progress. It’s a portrait of a Russia grappling with its heritage and
its future.

This review critiques V. Moss’s book, “Confusion in V. Moss. The
Orthodox Church at a Crossroads,” a translation of his work examining
the Orthodox Church, particularly focusing on Greece and Romania. The
reviewer finds the book interesting but ultimately flawed due to several
issues: the author’s obvious political and religious biases,
particularly anti-Soviet sentiment, internal contradictions, and a
selective presentation of history.

Specifically, the reviewer argues that the sections on Greece and
Romania are engaging due to the use of previously unavailable documents,
while the Russian sections are less compelling and informative. The
author’s interpretation of events, such as the perceived “failure” of
Tsar Nicholas II’s renunciation and the role of World War I in Russia’s
decline, is heavily skewed by his English perspective.

The reviewer also criticizes the book for ignoring key historical
periods and figures relevant to Russian Orthodox history, including the
First Fall of Constantinople, the Time of Troubles, and the writings of
P. Mogila. Despite containing some interesting details and previously
unknown facts, the reviewer concludes that the book is overly biased and
lacks a truly objective and scientific approach.

<p>
2002-08-26 - <b> Nikolay Konʹkov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a cynical and critical analysis of historical events,
primarily focusing on the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
subsequent rise of global capitalism. It uses extended analogies –
particularly the comparison of humans to crocodiles – to illustrate the
cyclical nature of power, adaptation, and ultimately, destruction.

The core argument is that the downfall of the USSR wasn’t a singular
event but a predictable consequence of a flawed adaptation to a changing
global landscape. The Soviet system, driven by a misguided attempt to
build a “consumer society,” failed to evolve sufficiently, becoming a
“mammoth” – a valuable resource eventually exhausted. The rise of “shark
capitalism” in the West, similarly, is portrayed as a predatory force,
exploiting vulnerabilities and ultimately consuming everything in its
path.

The author critiques the Western narrative of the Soviet collapse as a
triumph of “liberalism,” arguing that the “values” of the West were
ultimately hollow and self-serving. The text suggests a deterministic
view of history, where systems inevitably rise and fall based on their
ability to adapt, and that the West’s current dominance is merely a
temporary phase. It concludes with a bleak outlook, predicting a future
of escalating conflict and ultimately, the demise of Western power,
mirroring the fate of the Soviet Union.

The text is a satirical reflection on the resurgence of nostalgia for
the Soviet Union in post-Soviet Russia. It argues that, after years of
criticism and denigration, the Soviet Union is now viewed favorably by a
significant portion of the population, primarily due to dissatisfaction
with contemporary Russia’s economic and social conditions. The author
suggests this nostalgia stems from a desire for a perceived sense of
strength, purpose, and national pride, contrasting it with the perceived
weakness and mediocrity of modern Russia. The text uses vivid imagery
and hyperbolic language to highlight this trend, portraying it as a
reaction against perceived liberal failings and a yearning for a
simpler, more powerful national identity, often fueled by frustration
with current circumstances.

The text describes a chaotic and unsettling “Day of the City”
celebration in Moscow in 2002, portraying it as a heavily controlled,
almost dystopian event. The city was effectively sealed off with
roadblocks, police, and armed guards, creating a feeling of surveillance
and restriction. The atmosphere was tense, fueled by economic hardship,
social unrest, and a sense of impending doom, with rumors of planned
attacks and provocations circulating. Despite attempts to create a
festive atmosphere with concerts and staged performances, a violent
confrontation erupted at Moscow State University between different youth
groups, resulting in a fatality. The author argues that the event was a
manifestation of pent-up frustration and anger, highlighting the
disconnect between the planned celebration and the underlying social and
economic realities of the time. The text suggests that the controlled,
artificial celebration was ultimately unsuccessful and underscored the
deep-seated problems within Russian society.

<p>

This text is a scathing critique of Defence Minister Ivanov’s actions,
portraying him as a destructive figure who deliberately dismantled the
Russian Army’s air force and targeted experienced, capable officers. The
core argument is that Ivanov’s decisions were driven by personal
animosity towards the Chief of the General Staff, Anatoly Kvashnin,
rather than sound military judgment.

The article details how Ivanov, a former KGB officer, systematically
dismantled the Army Aviation, a vital component of Russian military
capabilities. He blamed lower-ranking officers for a helicopter crash,
using this as a pretext to eliminate experienced commanders and
consolidate power within the Ministry of Defence. The author highlights
the irony of Ivanov’s actions, given the increasing importance of
helicopter aviation in modern warfare, contrasting it with the declining
state of the Russian military – aging equipment, low morale, and a loss
of expertise.

The piece emphasizes the incompetence and destructive nature of Ivanov’s
leadership, portraying him as a figure who prioritized personal ambition
over the well-being and effectiveness of the armed forces. It concludes
with a pessimistic outlook, suggesting that Ivanov’s actions will

This text is a bitter, cynical commentary on a visit by President Putin
to the city of Novokuznetsk, Russia. The author expresses deep
resentment towards the current leadership and a perceived disconnect
between the government and the realities of life for ordinary citizens,
particularly in the region.

The visit is portrayed as a staged, superficial event designed to
project an image of engagement without addressing the city’s deep-seated
problems – poverty, unemployment, neglected infrastructure, and a
general sense of abandonment. The author highlights numerous instances
of this, including the manipulation of public spaces (the “Ozerny”
recreational facility), the exploitation of residents for security, and
the erasure of historical and cultural symbols (the lines from a poem by
Vladimir Mayakovsky).

The core of the text is a lament for the lost spirit of the city, a
place once vibrant and hopeful, now marred by corruption, inequality,
and the indifference of those in power. The author uses vivid imagery
and personal anecdotes to convey a sense of disillusionment and despair,
accusing the current leadership of prioritizing appearances over genuine
concern for the well-being of its people. The repeated phrase “Я знаю,

representing a forgotten promise and a lost dream. Ultimately, the text
is a powerful critique of political manipulation and a poignant

The text is a post-election analysis following a campaign in
Krasnoyarsk, led by Sergei Glaziev and Alexander Nagorniy. Glaziev
argues that the Patriotic Bloc’s victory in Krasnoyarsk, despite not
achieving a decisive win, was significant due to securing approximately
50% of the vote – a target for the coalition of the National Patriotic
Party and the Communist Party of Russia. He attributes this success to a
well-received program focused on rapid economic growth, utilizing the
region’s resources and aiming to halt capital flight, increase
industrial competitiveness, and improve living standards.

Glaziev criticizes the election process, alleging widespread
manipulation, including inflated spending by local officials,
unrestricted campaign advertising, and a flawed vote counting system
that defied statistical probability. He believes the key factor in the
Bloc’s success was the clarity of their message and the ability to
connect with voters concerned about the influence of oligarchs and the
perceived mismanagement of the economy.

He anticipates potential economic challenges stemming from a drop in oil
prices, predicting a possible fall to $7-8, which would negatively
impact Russia’s budget. However, he remains optimistic about the Bloc’s
program, believing it can drive economic growth regardless of external
fluctuations. He emphasizes the importance of continuing to educate the
public about the program’s goals and the need to combat misinformation.
Glaziev stresses the importance of the coalition’s unity – combining

<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the current approach to climate
change, arguing it’s fundamentally flawed and potentially catastrophic.
It details a scenario of escalating environmental disaster, primarily
driven by the rapid deforestation of Russia, particularly in the Moscow
region. The deforestation is exacerbating extreme weather events –
including damaging frosts and the recent devastating peat bog fires –
and contributing to a global climate crisis.

The core argument is that the dominant “sustainable development” (KUUR)
framework, promoted by developed nations, is ineffective and, in fact,
harmful. It focuses on simply reducing carbon emissions without
addressing the crucial role of natural carbon sinks like forests. The
author contends that Russia, with its vast forested areas, is a vital
“negative feedback” mechanism in stabilizing the climate, but current
policies are actively undermining this capability by exporting timber.

The text criticizes the “invisible hand of the market” as incapable of
self-regulation and argues that current economic policies, particularly
in Russia, are actively contributing to humanity’s demise. It proposes a
radically different approach: prioritizing the preservation and
expansion of natural carbon sinks, specifically emphasizing Russia’s
forests, as a key strategy for mitigating climate change. The author
concludes with a stark warning that the current trajectory is a
dangerous and ultimately self-destructive one.

Latvia, examining four potential paths for their future. The author,
Вячеслав Altukhov, heads the Russian Community of Latvia (ROL) and
expresses concern about the lack of support and opportunities for the

He identifies four primary paths: assimilation (already occurring, with
some Russian-speaking Latvians holding ministerial positions), rejection
of current realities and nostalgia for the Soviet Union, emigration to
Russia or Western countries, and integration as a bilingual nation – a
model similar to Canada.

The author criticizes the lack of unity among Russian organizations in
Latvia and calls for Russians to unite, elect their own representatives,
and address internal conflicts. He argues that the Russian community
needs to actively participate in Latvian society and demand equal
rights. He expresses skepticism about Russia’s continued support and
highlights the challenges of maintaining cultural identity in a rapidly

Strange units
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2002-10-07 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text details a complex and somewhat bizarre historical narrative
centered around the writings and beliefs of Pierre Drie La Rochelle, a
French journalist and observer from the 1940s. La Rochelle’s writings
reveal a deeply ambivalent and often contradictory perspective,
oscillating between fervent support for Soviet communism and a
surprisingly nostalgic embrace of aspects of fascism.

Throughout the 20th century, La Rochelle’s views were echoed by figures
like Konstantin Rodzayev, a leader of the “Union of Russian Fascists,”
who envisioned a unified “red-brown” movement. The narrative highlights
a recurring “strange unity” observed in Italy, particularly in 2001,
involving figures from across the political spectrum – including
neo-fascists, homosexual activists, Catholic integralists, and
representatives of various nationalist and anti-globalist movements.

The text suggests a persistent, albeit often overlooked, connection
between these disparate groups, fueled by a shared distrust of Western
liberalism and a fascination with alternative geopolitical visions,
notably the concept of a “euro-sovietic empire.” This connection is
further illustrated by the posthumous recognition of La Rochelle’s ideas
in Russia, reflecting a historical tendency to find common ground
between seemingly opposing ideologies. The narrative concludes with a
suggestion that this “strange unity” continues to resonate in
contemporary movements, particularly within anti-globalist and
nationalist circles, and that the historical roots of these movements
can be traced back to the complex and often contradictory perspectives
of figures like La Rochelle.

SIZE OF LEADERS

</p>
<p>

This text explores the recurring theme of “leader size” – the mismatch
between leadership capabilities and the complexity of historical
situations – across several pivotal moments in history. It argues that a
key factor in failures, such as the rise of fascism under Hitler and the
eventual collapse of traditional left and right-wing movements, is the
oversimplification of geopolitical challenges.

The analysis draws parallels between the failures of the German
leadership in the 20th century, particularly under Bismarck and Hitler,
and the later trends of “pink liberalism” within the Soviet Communist
Party and the adoption of conservative ideologies by Italian
neo-fascists. It highlights how leaders, like Napoleon and Hitler,
attempted to impose rigid, simplistic solutions on complex situations,
ultimately leading to disastrous outcomes.

The text suggests that a capacity for strategic foresight and
adaptability – akin to Bismarck’s approach – is crucial for navigating
uncertainty. It posits that future geopolitical shifts may lead to new
alliances and leadership figures who can anticipate and respond
effectively to unforeseen challenges, contrasting with the tendency to
rely on outdated models and simplistic solutions. The author references
historical figures like Bismarck and Stalin as examples of leaders who
possessed this crucial ability.

exclusion, and a disregard for genuine public opinion.

The author critiques the current political landscape, portraying it as a

Ultimately, the piece is a lament for the loss of genuine values and a

PROJECT “BABYLONIAN TOWERS”

<p>
2002-10-21 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text presents a conspiracy theory surrounding the events of 9/11
and the subsequent invasion of Iraq, arguing that these events were
orchestrated by powerful, “utopian” figures within the US government,
primarily dating back to the 1990s. The core argument is that the “New
Strategy for National Security,” developed by figures like Paul
Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, and Eric Edelman, aimed to establish a single
superpower and reshape the global order.

The text details a long-term plan originating in 1990, fueled by a
desire to create a “new world order” based on US financial and military
dominance. It claims that the 9/11 attacks were deliberately engineered
to justify this agenda, and that the invasion of Iraq was a key step in
achieving this goal, intended to benefit Israel and solidify US control.

The text draws upon a series of historical references, including the
biblical story of the Tower of Babel, to support its claims. It suggests
that figures like Henry Kissinger have long recognized this strategy and
that the current situation is a continuation of this plan. The text
posits that the US government, driven by a “utopian” vision, is willing
to sacrifice anything – including lives and international law – to
achieve its goals. It ultimately frames the events of 9/11 and the Iraq
War as a deliberate manipulation designed to establish a new world order
dominated by the United States.

This text is a transcript of a lengthy discussion between Gennady
Zyuganov and Valentin Chikin, focusing on the political landscape in
Russia following a controversial interview with Boris Berezovsky. The
core themes revolve around the perceived manipulation of public opinion
by the ruling elite, the emergence of Berezovsky as a significant,
albeit disruptive, political force, and the need for the Left Opposition
to strategically adapt and consolidate its position.

Here’s a summary of the key points:

-   **Berezovsky’s Influence:** The conversation centers around the
    impact of Berezovsky’s interview, which has triggered a significant
    reaction from the authorities and fueled public debate. The speakers
    acknowledge Berezovsky’s role in exposing corruption and challenging
    the established order.
-   **Government Manipulation:** The speakers express concern about the
    government’s attempts to discredit the Left Opposition and divert
    attention from legitimate grievances. They highlight the use of
    tactics like staged protests and misinformation campaigns.
-   **Strategic Adaptation:** The discussion emphasizes the need for the
    Left Opposition to learn from the Berezovsky situation, strengthen
    its organization, and develop a clear strategy for engaging with the
    public.
-   **Consolidation of the Left Opposition:** The speakers stress the
    importance of uniting diverse elements within the Left Opposition,
    including intellectuals, activists, and workers, to create a
    powerful and cohesive force.
-   **Focus on National Interests:** The core argument is that the Left
    Opposition must prioritize the interests of the Russian people and
    the country’s future, rather than being swayed by short-term
    political calculations.
-   **Call to Action:** The text concludes with a call for vigilance,
    strategic adaptation, and a renewed commitment to the goals of
    national unity, social justice, and democratic reform.

In essence, the transcript is a strategic assessment of a turbulent
political moment, urging the Left Opposition to respond decisively and
effectively to the challenges posed by the ruling elite.

<p>
Following the terrorist attack on Ulitsa Melnikova, it became clear that
terrorists could move freely through Moscow in vehicles, armed and
camouflaged, without fear. The terrorists likely arrived as spectators
at the “Nord-Ost” club, and the explosives were stored at the “Central
Station” club, owned by Chechens. The attack was a well-planned
provocation, and acquiring weapons and explosives in Moscow was readily
available. The editor suggests the Minister of Internal Affairs,
Gryzlov, should be questioned regarding this issue, but he was
unavailable at the time of the tragedy.

The text highlights the absurdity of the situation, detailing bizarre

This text is a highly critical and conspiratorial account of the 2002
Moscow theater siege. It argues that the event was not a simple
terrorist attack, but rather a deliberate provocation orchestrated to
undermine President Putin and destabilize Russia. The author contends
that Western media and political figures actively sought to humiliate
Russia, manipulating the situation to portray Putin as weak and
ineffective.

The narrative focuses on the actions of Russian special forces and
military personnel, portraying them as the true heroes who successfully
thwarted the attack and saved the country. It criticizes the actions of
government officials, analysts, and intellectuals, accusing them of
incompetence and manipulation. The text emphasizes the brutality of the
operation, particularly the swift and decisive elimination of the
hostage-takers, and frames the event as a battle for Russia’s future. It
suggests a deep-seated conspiracy involving Western forces aiming to
weaken Russia, and highlights the unwavering loyalty and courage of the
Russian military as the only genuine protectors of the nation.

Pol Virilio’s “Informational Bomb” is a scathing, uncompromising
critique of contemporary society, arguing that the relentless
bombardment of information through media is leading humanity towards a

by visual media and instant information, is shrinking the world,
reducing human experience to a shallow, illusory existence. He sees this
as a descent into infantile behavior, mirroring a “lemming” instinct,
and a loss of responsibility. The book’s forceful, almost apocalyptic
tone, coupled with its perceived lack of nuance or a specific solution,
ultimately leaves the reader feeling apathetic and overwhelmed,

</p>
<p>

This text details a complex and somewhat murky history involving
Soviet-era arms deals to Africa, primarily with Angola, and the
subsequent exploitation of these deals by individuals like Arkady
Gaidamak and Viktor Malkin. Initially, the Soviet Union provided
significant aid and weaponry to African nations, driven by geopolitical
interests and a desire to expand its influence. Following the collapse
of the USSR, Gaidamak and Malkin capitalized on this legacy, engaging in
a series of transactions involving Angolan debt and the sale of Soviet
military equipment. They established a network of contacts, including
within the Paris Club of creditors, and ultimately facilitated the
purchase of weapons by the Angolan government.

This operation involved a complex web of payments, including the
issuance of promissory notes and the manipulation of debt obligations.
The duo’s activities led to accusations of illegal arms dealing and
involvement with organizations like Al-Qaeda, though evidence remains
circumstantial.

More recently, Gaidamak and his partner Vladimir Ananich have expanded
their operations into the media sector, launching a Russian-language
television channel, “Russkiy Mir,” aimed at international audiences.
This represents a new phase in their business ventures, leveraging their
established connections and expertise in international trade and
finance. The text highlights the ongoing involvement of figures like
Viktor But, who was previously involved in the Russian stock exchange,
and suggests a broader, potentially global, media strategy. The
narrative emphasizes the opportunistic nature of their activities and
their ability to adapt and exploit new opportunities, demonstrating a
persistent and evolving business model.

This text outlines a complex web of political and economic developments
across multiple countries. In Russia, Anatoly Chubois is consolidating
power following Vladimir Putin’s absence, attempting to discredit the
Communist Party and manage “siloviki” activity. Simultaneously, the US
presidential election has eased tensions with Congress, while the UN
Security Council’s resolution on Iraq has delayed potential military
action. This delay, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s interest rate
cuts, is contributing to a financial crisis. China is pursuing an
ambitious economic growth program, and Gazprom is attempting to gain
control over the “Slavneft” company, potentially influenced by interests
within the Russian government. Finally, there are indications of a
significant gay lobby operating within the close circle of Boris

The text describes the 2002 NATO summit in Prague as a pivotal moment
solidifying the alliance’s shift towards a more assertive, pro-American,
and anti-Russian posture. It argues that the summit marked the end of
illusions about Russia’s influence and the beginning of a new era where
NATO actively seeks to expand its control over the post-Soviet space.
The summit was characterized by the increasing military presence of NATO
in Eastern Europe, particularly in the Baltic states, and the alliance’s
attempts to integrate former Soviet republics. The text highlights the
symbolic importance of the summit, the diminishing role of European
powers in shaping NATO’s direction, and the growing influence of the
United States. It portrays a shift in Russia’s geopolitical position,
returning to a 17th-century-like confrontation with the West, and a
growing sense of disillusionment within Russia regarding its own

This text is a lengthy, reflective essay by Stanislav Konyayev (Stasya
Konyayev) about his life and work, primarily focusing on his poetic
journey and evolving worldview. It’s a deeply personal and often
contradictory account, marked by a strong sense of Russian national
identity and a willingness to confront difficult truths.

Konyayev describes his life and poetry as a constant, winding path –
sometimes a well-trodden road, other times a solitary, challenging trek
through diverse landscapes, both physical and intellectual. He
emphasizes the importance of following one’s own internal compass,
resisting external pressures and trends, particularly within the
literary scene. He recounts a pivotal moment in his career when he
rejected the popular “good with fists” stance, initially promoted by
Vadim Kozhinov, viewing it as a constraint on his artistic freedom. He
acknowledges the influence of Kozhinov, recognizing him as a significant
figure in shaping his poetic direction, but ultimately prioritizes his
own deeply rooted, almost primal, connection to Russia.

The essay explores Konyayev’s evolving relationship with Russia, moving
from a more localized, regional identity to a broader, almost imperial,
perspective. He grapples with the complexities of being a Russian poet
in a changing world, confronting themes of national identity, historical
memory, and the burdens of leadership. He frequently expresses a sense
of disillusionment and weariness, acknowledging the pain and suffering
inherent in Russia’s past and present.

A central theme is the tension between his personal convictions and the
expectations placed upon him by others, particularly within the literary
establishment. He repeatedly asserts his independence and willingness to
challenge conventional wisdom, even when it means going against popular
opinion. He highlights the importance of courage, resilience, and a
willingness to stand up for one’s beliefs, even in the face of
adversity.

The text culminates in a reflection on the nature of heroism and
sacrifice, suggesting that true heroism lies not in grand gestures but
in quiet acts of defiance and unwavering commitment to one’s values. He
concludes with a sense of having “won” – having endured the “fire” – and
a renewed determination to continue fighting for what he believes in,
ultimately embodying the spirit of “good with fists.” The essay is a
testament to a life lived passionately and authentically, marked by a
profound love for Russia and a relentless pursuit of truth.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko represents a rebellious and

Lukashenko’s assertiveness, fueled by Russian gas supplies and his own

Chechnya and Abkhazia, are intended to provoke a reaction from Russia

This text is an analysis of the 2002 gubernatorial election in
Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, focusing on the surprising victory of
Alexander Khloponin. It critiques the previous governors, particularly
Professor Zubov and General Lebed, who were widely seen as incompetent
and wasteful. The article highlights the key factors that led to
Khloponin’s success: his background as a successful businessman
(previously heading Norilsk Nickel), his pragmatic approach to
governance, and his ability to quickly address the region’s economic
problems.

Khloponin’s strategy involved aligning himself with the needs of major
industrial groups while simultaneously addressing the region’s financial
difficulties. He implemented measures like raising energy tariffs for
large businesses to benefit the population and securing increased
revenue from Norilsk Nickel. He also fostered a collaborative
relationship with the regional legislature, emphasizing a focus on
practical solutions and a rejection of ideological divisions. The
article suggests that voters were essentially choosing a skilled manager
– someone who could effectively run the region’s economy – rather than a
governor based on political affiliation. The comparison to previous
governors, particularly those with backgrounds in party leadership,
underscores the shift towards valuing managerial competence. Ultimately,
the article argues that Khloponin’s victory represented a return to a
more traditional, results-oriented approach to governance, suggesting
that the best governors are those who can successfully manage
production.

</p>
<p>

This 2002 article, written by Boris Berezovsky and published in
“Независимая газета,” analyzes the Russian political landscape leading
up to the 2003 parliamentary elections. The core argument is that the
only viable opposition force is the Communist Party of the Russian
Federation (KПРФ), and that achieving either the “minimum” goal of
securing over 150 seats in the Duma or the “maximum” goal of winning a
majority (226 seats) is dependent on a coalition led by КПРФ.

Berezovsky argues that despite support from segments of the liberal
opposition, particularly after the collapse of “Liberal Russia,” the
КПРФ remains the key player due to its significant public support and
the perceived infiltration of pro-Kremlin forces within its ranks. He
stresses the importance of the КПРФ’s ability to forge alliances,
specifically with liberals, to overcome the potential barrier of 150
seats.

The article highlights the differing ideological positions between the
Communists and Liberals, acknowledging areas of potential agreement,
such as constitutional reform and foreign policy, while recognizing that
disagreements will inevitably exist regarding economic issues.
Ultimately, Berezovsky frames the potential alliance as a necessary,
albeit complex, strategy to counter the perceived authoritarian
tendencies of the Putin regime and to mobilize a broad “patriotic”
opposition.

This text is a lengthy analysis and optimistic report on the development
of the “Agrocomplex” in the village of Vyselki, Krasnodar Krai, Russia,
and the subsequent rise of the “Patriotic Movement ‘Fatherland’,” led by
Nikolai Kondratenko and spearheaded by Alexander Tkachov. It details the
origins of the Agrocomplex as a response to economic hardship and the
influence of Western economic models, particularly the shift from a
system of survival to one of prosperity.

The core narrative focuses on how a young entrepreneur, Alexander
Tkachov, transformed a collection of struggling agricultural enterprises
into a highly efficient and profitable integrated agricultural system.
This was achieved through a radical restructuring, consolidating
resources, implementing market-based principles, and fostering a culture
of innovation and productivity.

The text highlights the key factors contributing to the Agrocomplex’s
success: a pragmatic approach, a focus on efficiency, and a willingness
to learn from Western economic models. It emphasizes the importance of
strong leadership and a commitment to continuous improvement.

Crucially, the piece argues that the Agrocomplex’s success demonstrates
a viable path for Russia’s economic development, suggesting that
individuals with practical business experience and a strategic vision
are better equipped to guide the country’s economic future than those
solely focused on political maneuvering.

Finally, the text concludes with a hopeful note, asserting that the
Agrocomplex’s model – a combination of patriotism and pragmatic business
acumen – represents a promising approach for Russia’s economic
development and that the victory of the “Patriotic Movement
‘Fatherland’” in the Krasnodar Krai legislative elections signals a
positive shift in the country’s political landscape.

This text is a scathing critique of contemporary Russian political
leadership, arguing that their actions and statements reveal a profound
lack of understanding, strategic thinking, and genuine concern for
Russia’s interests. It uses historical examples and rhetorical questions
to highlight what the author perceives as a pattern of deception,
self-deception, and ultimately, incompetence. The core argument is that
the current leadership is characterized by a “cretinism,” “debiolism,”
and “idiolism” – a combination of intellectual deficiency, poor
judgment, and a willingness to accept misleading assurances from foreign
powers like the United States.

The text employs sarcasm and irony to expose the perceived absurdity of

regarding NATO expansion and Russia’s relationship with the West. It
repeatedly questions the motivations and credibility of key figures,
suggesting they are driven by a desire to maintain power rather than by
a genuine commitment to national security or international cooperation.
The author uses historical comparisons – referencing Stalin’s careful
observation and strategic thinking – to contrast sharply with the
perceived failings of the current leadership, suggesting a decline in
Russia’s intellectual and political capacity. Ultimately, the text is a
lament for a lost sense of national pride, strategic foresight, and

This text is a highly critical and conspiratorial analysis of the
US-Russia Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) and the broader
relationship between the two countries from 2002. It argues that the
treaty was not a genuine effort at arms reduction but rather a carefully
orchestrated scheme by the United States to weaken Russia’s military
capabilities and exert greater global influence.

The core argument is that the US, through a network of
“non-governmental” research centers and by manipulating Russian experts
and officials, systematically undermined Russia’s strategic nuclear
deterrent. The text details how the US exploited Russia’s post-Cold War
vulnerability, using misleading language in the treaty itself, and
failing to establish effective verification mechanisms. It claims that
the US deliberately created a situation where Russia was forced to
dismantle its strategic weapons under conditions that ultimately
benefited the US.

Specifically, the text highlights:

-   **Misleading Treaty Language:** The text points out discrepancies
    and ambiguities in the START I treaty, suggesting they were
    intentionally designed to disadvantage Russia.
-   **Non-Governmental Influence:** It emphasizes the role of US-based
    research centers and “non-governmental” experts in shaping Russian
    policy and influencing the treaty negotiations.
-   **Lack of Verification:** The text criticizes the inadequate
    verification mechanisms in the treaty, allowing the US to
    effectively monitor and potentially manipulate Russia’s compliance.
-   **Conspiracy:** The overall tone suggests a deliberate conspiracy by
    the US to exploit Russia’s weakness and achieve strategic dominance.

The document presents a highly skeptical and accusatory view of the
treaty process, portraying it as a strategic maneuver rather than a
collaborative effort for global security. It’s filled with assertions of
deception and manipulation, framing the treaty as a key element in a
larger US strategy to diminish Russia’s power.

<p>

This text, dated December 17, 2002, is a bleak assessment of the Chechen
conflict, painted by a journalist who previously reported from
Afghanistan. The author expresses a profound sense of hopelessness
regarding the situation, describing it as a “proklyтое место” (cursed
place). He argues that the war is entering a perpetual state, with no
prospect of peace and a deeply entrenched, almost suicidal, cycle of
violence.

The journalist’s observations highlight a complete breakdown of
communication and trust between Russians and Chechens. He believes the
conflict is primarily a civil war amongst the Chechens themselves,
fueled by clan rivalries and a deep-seated resentment of Russian
influence. Chechens view the conflict as a righteous struggle against an
oppressive foreign power, while Russian officials maintain a naive
belief that the Chechens will eventually accept Russian dominance.

The author emphasizes the lack of any realistic solutions, noting that
neither side is willing to compromise. He describes a situation where
both Russians and Chechens are motivated by self-interest – Russians
seeking to maintain control and Chechens hoping for a future where
Russia pays them compensation. The journalist’s previous experience in
Afghanistan informs his pessimistic outlook, stating that he has never
witnessed such a bleak and intractable situation. He concludes that the
conflict is a tragic, unending cycle with no foreseeable end.

This text details a growing alignment between Russian oil giants,
particularly Lukoil under the leadership of Vagif Alekperov, and the
United States, driven by economic pressures and geopolitical
considerations. Lukoil’s decision to sever a contract with Iraqi oil
firm Saddam Hussein’s government, prompted by sanctions and a perceived
lack of trust, was largely orchestrated by US influence, facilitated by
figures like Arkady Chuibchev. Alekperov’s proposal to shift Russian oil
exports to the US, including the construction of a massive terminal in
Murmansk and new pipelines, is presented as a strategically motivated
move to secure a “backup airfield” for Lukoil executives and their
families, given recent security concerns. The project is viewed as
economically unsound, particularly if oil prices decline, and is
ultimately seen as a result of a shift in priorities towards Western
interests rather than genuine economic benefit for Russia. The text
suggests a pattern of Russian oligarchs seeking refuge and business
opportunities within the US, potentially at the expense of domestic
needs and with the support of US intelligence and economic actors.

This text is a detailed, almost epic, recounting of Viktor Volkov’s
tenure as the head of the Chernsky District, a region in the Tula Oblast
of Russia. It’s a story of a man deeply connected to his region’s
history and identity, particularly its ties to the writer Ivan Turgenev
and the area’s traditional Russian heritage. Volkov’s leadership is
characterized by a relentless focus on revitalizing the district, often
through unconventional and sometimes controversial methods.

Initially, he spearheaded a “Turgenev Summer” festival, leveraging
Turgenev’s connection to the region to boost its profile. He then
systematically addressed the district’s decline, implementing a series
of ambitious projects including restoring historical sites, supporting
local culture, and boosting the local economy. This involved a hands-on
approach, often personally overseeing projects like rebuilding churches,
organizing agricultural initiatives, and managing the district’s
finances with a meticulous, almost obsessive, attention to detail –
including tracking every brick, ton of grain, and even the number of
people attending events.

Volkov’s leadership style is portrayed as strong-willed, bordering on
autocratic, driven by a deep sense of regional pride and a desire to
preserve its unique identity. He fostered a loyal team, often recruiting
individuals with a passion for the district’s history and culture. His
methods were frequently disruptive, involving clashes with Moscow
officials and generating considerable local legend. The text highlights
his ability to mobilize the local population, utilizing their skills and
resources to achieve his goals, and his willingness to challenge
established norms. Ultimately, Volkov’s story is one of a dedicated, if
somewhat eccentric, leader who fought tirelessly to preserve and
revitalize his region, leaving behind a legacy of ambitious projects and
enduring local legend.

This text expresses deep skepticism and concern regarding the actions
and motivations of both the Russian Orthodox Church and the Vatican,
framing the exchange of a Christmas message between Patriarch Alexey II
and Pope John Paul II as a strategic move rather than a genuine gesture
of reconciliation. The author argues that both institutions are being
manipulated by forces seeking to undermine religious freedom and
establish a global “New World Order” characterized by control through
technology, financial systems, and ultimately, a loss of individual
liberty.

The core argument is that the “peaceful” exchange is a calculated
tactic, driven by a desire to bring the Orthodox Church under state
control through financial and technological means, mirroring concerns
about the erosion of religious autonomy and the rise of a totalitarian
system. The author highlights anxieties about the increasing influence
of global elites, the manipulation of religious institutions, and the
potential for a “concentration camp” scenario where individual freedoms
are curtailed through technological surveillance and financial control.
The text concludes with a warning to remain vigilant against these
perceived threats, suggesting a long and difficult period of “suffering”
for the Orthodox Church.

The text describes a disillusioned observer’s experience living in a
Berlin apartment complex. The narrator details the ineffective presence
of a private security guard named “Alligator,” who largely ignores
disruptive behavior in the courtyard, including drunken revelry, illegal
activities like smuggling, and the general lack of order. The security
guard prioritizes avoiding confrontation and deferring to his superior,
demonstrating a lack of responsibility and a cynical view of his role.
The narrator questions the purpose and value of private security firms
and their presence in daily life, highlighting the feeling of being
exploited and the lack of accountability. The overall tone is one of
frustration and bewilderment at the seemingly pointless expenditure of
resources and the disconnect between the security force and the
community it’s supposed to protect.
