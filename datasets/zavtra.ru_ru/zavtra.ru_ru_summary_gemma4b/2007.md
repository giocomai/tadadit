The text details a long-standing theory surrounding Mozart’s death,
suggesting he was poisoned. It recounts a history of investigations,
starting with a neutron-activation analysis of Mozart’s hair conducted
by physicists, including B.G., and later utilizing hair samples obtained
through a chain of ownership, including Vera Lurie and Viktor Tolmachev.
The investigation began with a theory based on the work of German
musicologists and physicians, and involved the examination of a hair
sample taken from Mozart’s head after his death. The whereabouts of the
hair sample and related artifacts, including a posthumous mask, are
traced through various owners, including the Graf von Daume-Müller, his
widow, and sculptor Willy Kauaer. The text references a website
(www.wamocart.narod.ru) where excerpts from the research novel can be
found.

The text recounts a humorous and absurd situation involving a retired
scientist, Mikhail Ivanovich, who cultivates a successful vegetable
garden. He is falsely accused of “anti-presidential” behavior due to his
thriving harvest attracting attention and demand. An exasperated police
officer, reacting to Mikhail Ivanovich’s complaints about theft and his
perceived criticism of the government, escalates the situation,
demanding he celebrate his successful produce as a sign of Russia’s
competitiveness. The officer’s increasingly aggressive and illogical
accusations, culminating in threats of violence, highlight the absurdity
of the situation and the overreaction to a simple, successful hobby.
Ultimately, the story satirizes bureaucratic rigidity and the tendency
to misinterpret success as subversive activity.

This text outlines a complex and concerning situation surrounding
Belarus’s geopolitical standing and economic future. It details a
coordinated effort by the United States, the European Union, and Russia
to exert pressure on Belarus, primarily through economic sanctions and
strategic maneuvering.

The core issue revolves around Belarus’s independent economic policies,
particularly its refusal to fully align with Russia’s economic
interests, as perceived by Moscow. The US and EU are supporting this
stance through financial and political support, while Russia appears to
be deliberately undermining Belarus’s economy through actions like
raising gas prices and imposing new tariffs on oil supplies.

The text highlights a perceived “geopolitical choice” for Belarus, with
Russia seemingly unwilling to accept its independence and instead
attempting to isolate it. Despite warnings about potential sanctions
from both the US and EU, Belarusian President Lukashenko expresses
confidence in the country’s ability to withstand the pressure,
suggesting a history of overcoming similar challenges. The article
emphasizes the ongoing struggle for Belarus’s sovereignty and the
potential for significant economic disruption due to these external
pressures.

This lengthy text is a passionate and somewhat alarmist critique of the
state of Russian education and its perceived decline since the collapse
of the Soviet Union. It argues that the current system is failing to
adequately prepare young people for the future and is contributing to a
dangerous erosion of Russian identity and values.

The author identifies several key problems: a disconnect between
education and practical skills, a lack of traditional values, and a
growing influence of Western culture. They advocate for a return to
pedagogical approaches developed by figures like Kostyakshin, Shtetin,
and Tylen, emphasizing a combination of practical training, character
development, and patriotic education. Crucially, the text stresses the
importance of strengthening institutions like military schools and
vocational training centers.

The author expresses a strong belief in the resilience of the Russian
people and their ability to overcome these challenges through a renewed
commitment to education and national identity. They conclude with a
hopeful vision of a “Fifth Empire” arising from a revitalized
educational system. The piece is filled with evocative language and a
sense of urgency, portraying education as a critical battleground for
the future of Russia.

This text details the complex and increasingly bizarre investigation
surrounding the arrest of banker Alexei Frenkel, initially suspected in
connection with the murder of Central Bank of Russia first deputy
chairman Andrey Kozlov. The core of the story revolves around a lengthy,
potentially fabricated, letter sent by Frenkel to journalist Alexei
Mamonov, containing accusations of corruption within the Central Bank
and predictions about the future role of the bank in determining the
succession of President Putin.

The narrative quickly spirals into a web of speculation and intrigue,
fueled by conflicting accounts and insinuations. Initially, Mamonov’s
role is highlighted, followed by the suggestion that Frenkel was using
him as a secure channel for information. The investigation then shifts
to implicate larger figures, with accusations of a “big game” involving
powerful individuals and a deliberate attempt to frame Frenkel.

The text explores various theories surrounding the murder of Kozlov,
initially portraying him as a “knight fighting windmills” against
corruption, but then revealing his significant involvement in the 1998
financial crisis and his subsequent work for a US-funded organization.
The story highlights the potential manipulation of public perception
surrounding Kozlov’s death and the use of his legacy to discredit
Frenkel.

Ultimately, the text presents a highly skeptical view of the official
investigation, suggesting it is deliberately obfuscated and driven by
powerful interests. It emphasizes the potential for a complex,
politically motivated “epic” narrative to emerge from the case, with the
possibility of significant figures manipulating events for their own
gain. The text concludes with a warning that the investigation is likely
to remain closed and secretive, and that the truth behind the events
will likely remain obscured.

This text highlights two figures – oil oligarchs and Генrich Abramov –
as key to Russia’s recent history. The oligarchs are portrayed as
benefiting greatly from the Soviet system, prioritizing profit over
national interests. In contrast, Генrich Abramov represents the
dedication and skill of Soviet engineers and scientists who built the
nation’s industrial base, particularly in the Siberian oil and gas
sector. Abramov’s story is one of resilience; he saved his factory,
Sibnefteautomtika, from collapse during the 1990s economic turmoil,
demonstrating a commitment to preserving Soviet-era production. The text
argues that Abramov’s success and the factory’s survival are worth
acknowledging and that the current President’s efforts to stabilize and
strengthen Russia are crucial, deserving continued support despite the
challenges and resistance encountered. It emphasizes the need for
continued progress and stability, drawing a parallel to the need to

The article details a series of geopolitical and economic developments
in 2007, primarily focusing on Russia’s shifting relationships with the
West. Putin’s meetings with Yeltsin were framed as a signal to the West
regarding Russia’s reform course, while his speeches emphasized
counter-terrorism and addressing economic inequality. A crackdown on
leaked information related to corruption within the Central Bank of
Russia was linked to Putin’s positive assessments of the bank. Russia’s
plans to create a “gas OPEC” (OGEK) and redirect gas exports to China
were seen as a strategic maneuver to pressure Europe and consolidate
power, causing concern in the EU and US. The US, meanwhile, was
attempting to disrupt China’s space program and escalate the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while also downplaying any immediate plans
for military action against Iran. Finally, Hugo Chavez’s demands for
foreign companies to participate in Venezuela’s “social state” or leave
were interpreted as a form of nationalization, and the purchase of
Russian air defense systems by Venezuela was viewed as a counterweight
to NATO’s missile defense systems in Eastern Europe.

Irina Arkhipova’s life story, recounted in this article, is one of
remarkable longevity and success in the music world. Born in 1926, she
began her career late, at age 30, after a diverse background including
architecture. Despite a challenging start, marked by initial setbacks
and a perceived lack of support, she persevered and achieved
international recognition as a legendary soprano.

The article highlights Arkhipova’s unique journey, emphasizing her
self-reliance, determination, and ability to foster connections within
the music community. She founded and led numerous international
organizations, including the International Union of Composers and
Performers, and organized significant music festivals and competitions.

A key theme is Arkhipova’s resilience in the face of adversity,
particularly her delayed recognition and the challenges she encountered
in a rapidly changing Soviet system. Despite initial criticism and a
perceived lack of support, she continued to produce high-quality work
and inspire young musicians. The article portrays her as a constant

<p>

This text is a lengthy interview with Roman Neumov, a former leader of
the Russian rock band “Instruction on Survival,” now living near the
Pskov-Pechersk Monastery. Neumov discusses his shift towards a more
spiritual life, influenced by his time in the monastery and his evolving
relationship with music. He expresses a deep skepticism about the impact
of rock music, particularly its potential to lead to spiritual emptiness
and destructive behaviors, citing examples from his own experiences and
observations of other musicians.

Neumov emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, advocating for
moderation and a focus on spiritual well-being. He views rock music as a
potentially harmful force, especially for young people, and highlights
the need for discernment. He describes his current musical tastes as
more contemplative, influenced by figures like John Coltrane and the
monastic chants of Valamara.

The interview reveals Neumov’s paradoxical existence – a former rock
musician now deeply involved in Orthodox spirituality, grappling with
the tension between his past and his present. He expresses a desire for
a smaller, more understanding audience and a cautious approach to the
influence of modern culture, particularly rock music, on young people.
He also touches on the broader cultural landscape, including the
challenges of forming a distinct Russian rock identity and the need for
authenticity and spiritual grounding.

The article, published in 2007, argues that the United States’ strategic
goals extend beyond the immediate conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It
posits that Washington’s primary focus is to maintain control over
global energy resources, specifically disrupting China’s access to
energy routes. The US intends to achieve this by manipulating regional
conflicts (particularly in Iraq and Central Asia), leveraging Turkey as
a key partner to construct a massive gas pipeline from Turkmenistan
through the Caspian Sea and into Europe, and ultimately positioning
Turkey as a frontline state against China. The author suggests this
strategy involves exploiting Russian internal divisions and using Russia
as a pawn in a broader geopolitical struggle. The article concludes that
the US aims to force Russia into a difficult choice: align with NATO and
accept US military presence along its borders, or face energy isolation
and economic pressure.

2007-03-13 - <b> Vladimir Bondarenko </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, passionate tribute to the writer Valentin
Rasputin, arguing that he represents a deep, enduring, and critical
voice within Russian national identity. It posits that Rasputin’s work,
particularly his stark and often unsettling portrayals of Russian
history and society, reflects a profound understanding of the nation’s
soul – a “sacred Russia” that has always existed beneath the surface of
official narratives.

The core argument is that Rasputin’s writing isn’t simply literary; it’s
a vital, almost prophetic, force, constantly challenging the dominant
interpretations of Russian history and urging the nation to confront
uncomfortable truths. He’s portrayed as a “voice from the depths,” a
guardian of a traditional, often critical, Russian spirit that has been
repeatedly suppressed.

The text emphasizes Rasputin’s persistent focus on themes of national
identity, historical memory, and the potential for Russia to correct its
course. It suggests his work is a warning, a call to action, and a
reminder of the nation’s enduring connection to its roots. The author
views Rasputin as a crucial figure for understanding Russia’s present
and future, arguing that his voice, though often overlooked, remains
profoundly relevant. The piece concludes with a fervent expression of
admiration and a belief that Rasputin’s legacy will continue to shape
Russia’s destiny.

On March 21, 2007, a group associated with the Eurasian Youth Union
(EUM) organized a protest and attempted to symbolically “storm” the
Dutch Embassy in Moscow to commemorate the first anniversary of Slobodan
Milošević’s death and to express their support for him as a “hero” of
Eurasian resistance against the United States, NATO, and the
Netherlands. The event was intended as a symbolic act of defiance and
remembrance, involving planned disruption and the use of improvised
tools like chairs and handcuffs. The protest was met with a significant
police response, resulting in the arrest of several EUM activists,
including the detention of seven individuals and the hospitalization of
one officer. Following the incident, the authorities attempted to
downplay the event, and the seized items were taken into evidence. The
group plans a larger “Imperial March” on April 8th, aiming to promote
their values and honoring figures like Milošević, Arkan, Stalin, and

This text is a scathing critique of the Russian government’s “National
Projects,” particularly the “Education” project, and the implementation
of the Unified State Exam (EGE). The author, Sergei Komkov, a former
school principal, argues that these projects are largely a waste of
money, driven by corruption and a misguided attempt to modernize
education. He expresses deep skepticism about the goals of the projects,
viewing them as part of a broader “Russian Project” aimed at controlling
and diminishing the Russian population.

Komkov criticizes the significant funding allocated to the EGE, arguing
it’s a flawed system that devalues traditional academic assessment,
fosters competition over genuine learning, and exacerbates inequalities
within the education system. He highlights the lack of transparency and
accountability surrounding the project’s funding, pointing to widespread
corruption and the exploitation of teachers and schools. He expresses
concern about the shrinking number of students pursuing teaching as a
career due to low salaries and lack of support.

Ultimately, Komkov sees the “Education” project as a destructive force,
contributing to the decline of Russian education and the nation’s
future. He calls for a fundamental shift in approach, prioritizing
investment in quality education and supporting teachers, rather than
pursuing short-sighted, politically motivated schemes.

<p>

This lengthy text is a satirical and highly critical report detailing
the activities of the Baltics State Technical University “Voyenmeh”
(Military Technical University) in Moscow in 2006-2007. It describes a
series of bizarre and seemingly orchestrated events involving student
life, funding, and external influences.

The core of the report focuses on the university’s involvement with the
“Centre National de la Gloire” (National Centre of Glory), a seemingly
dubious organization funded by a combination of sources, including
student funds and potentially illicit means. The Centre’s activities
involve hosting a diverse and often contradictory group of visitors,
including pro-Kremlin youth groups, foreign dignitaries (particularly
from the US and NATO countries), and even former Nazi German soldiers.

The report highlights a stark contrast in the treatment of these
visitors versus the students themselves. While foreign guests and
prominent figures enjoyed lavish meals and comfortable accommodations,
the students were provided with minimal resources and faced significant
financial hardship. The university’s administration, led by a series of
politically appointed rectors (initially Yuri Savelyev and then Viktor
Yuraikov), engaged in questionable practices, including diverting funds
and manipulating student affairs.

The report is filled with absurd details, such as the students’ assigned
seating arrangements (yellow and magenta trousers for certain groups,
bells in their noses for others), and the constant monitoring of student
behavior by security personnel (“ecilops”). It satirizes the idea of
“national glory” and the manipulation of youth for political purposes.
The text ultimately portrays a chaotic and cynical environment where
ideological purity and political maneuvering trump genuine student
welfare. The report ends with a critical assessment of the Centre’s
operations and a lack of clarity regarding the distinction between
genuine students and those favored by the organization.

The text is a stream of consciousness narrative exploring themes of
memory, legacy, and the cyclical nature of Russian history through the
lens of a new wealthy landowner, Andrey Titishchev, purchasing and
attempting to revive a dilapidated aristocratic estate. It’s a
fragmented, almost surreal account filled with anecdotes about past
lives – a currency exchange operator, a businessman, a “hero” – all
interwoven with the present situation of Andrey trying to restore the
estate and grapple with its history. The narrative jumps between
Andrey’s current efforts (buying the estate, renovating a piano,
attempting to cultivate the land) and memories of past lives, often
presented in a dreamlike or illogical way. It’s a meditation on the
weight of the past, the illusion of control, and the difficulty of truly
understanding one’s place in history. The story is characterized by a
sense of disorientation and a blurring of reality and memory,
culminating in a final, almost hallucinatory observation about the
sounds of the house – a piano, a metronome, and the distant rumble of a
train, representing the relentless march of time and the inescapable
echoes of the past.

This text details the highly controversial trial of Vladimir Vlasov and
Mikhail Klevachev, accused of involvement in the bombing of a train (the
“Grozny-Moscow”) in 2005. Initially investigated as a terrorist act, the
case was ultimately dismissed by a jury of citizens (the “people’s
court”) who found them not guilty. However, the trial was abruptly
halted after the jury was disbanded, allegedly due to concerns about
their objectivity. The prosecution, using fabricated evidence and
pressure tactics, successfully manipulated the proceedings, leading to
the men’s conviction and sentencing. The text highlights the systemic
flaws within the Russian legal system, including the manipulation of
citizen juries, the use of fabricated evidence, and the intimidation of
witnesses. It emphasizes the lack of genuine investigation and the
apparent intent to frame the two men. The author expresses deep concern
about the erosion of due process and the potential for abuse of power,
concluding with a pessimistic view of the situation and a feeling of
helplessness against a system seemingly designed to persecute the
innocent.

The article discusses the shifting foreign policy of U.S. President
George W. Bush, framing it as a “Termidor” moment – a turning point in a
revolution where radicalism fades and a pragmatic approach emerges. It
analyzes Bush’s recent moves, including negotiations with Iran and
Syria, a shift away from the “democratic revolution” rhetoric, and

concerns about Bush’s willingness to use military force, particularly
regarding Iran’s nuclear program, and questions his constitutional
authority to do so without congressional approval. It suggests a
potential path to resolution involves reaching a deal with Iran to halt
its uranium enrichment program, acknowledging the complex and

<p>

This text analyzes the precarious situation of Gazprom, highlighting a
complex web of geopolitical and economic pressures. It argues that
Gazprom is facing a coordinated campaign by Western powers, Ukraine, and
Central Asian nations to diminish its influence in the European gas
market. The core of the issue revolves around Ukraine’s control of key
transit routes and its attempts to leverage its position for political
gain.

The text details how Gazprom’s export volumes are being challenged
through Central Asia and the potential for Ukraine to further disrupt
gas flows to Europe. It emphasizes the vulnerability of Gazprom’s
position due to its reliance on transit through Ukraine and the growing
influence of alternative gas supply routes. The author suggests that
Gazprom’s current strategy, including the meeting between Alexei Miller
and Yuriy Boiko, is a deliberate attempt to project an image of
stability while facing significant challenges. Ultimately, the text
paints a picture of a highly unstable situation where Gazprom’s future
is uncertain due to external pressures and internal vulnerabilities.

</p>
<p>

This text is a detailed analysis of the political climate in Russia
around 2007, specifically focusing on Vladimir Putin’s potential third
term and the underlying tensions within the ruling elite. It argues that
Putin’s position is built on a fragile “coalition of four” – Putin
himself, the security services, a segment of the oligarchs, and the
regional governors – which is increasingly unstable due to corruption,
internal power struggles, and external pressures.

The core argument is that Putin’s rule is predicated on a precarious
balance of power, threatened by the rise of corruption within the
security apparatus and the potential for a destabilizing “orange
revolution” style event. The author highlights the growing influence of
the security services, particularly their integration into the corrupt
system, and the potential for this to undermine Putin’s authority.

Furthermore, the text analyzes the external pressures on Russia,
primarily the United States’ attempts to create a unipolar world and the
resulting geopolitical competition. It suggests that the US, through
figures like George W. Bush and the “neocons,” were actively attempting
to destabilize Russia and undermine Putin’s rule.

Ultimately, the text concludes that Putin’s position is inherently
vulnerable and that his decision to seek a third term would likely
trigger a cascade of events leading to the collapse of the ruling
coalition and potentially a significant political crisis. It frames the
situation as a battle for control within the Russian elite, with the
future of the country hanging in the balance.

Between “Dictatorship of Development” and Patching Holes
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2007-05-08 - <b> Maksim Kalashnikov </b>
</p>
<p>

The text is a pessimistic analysis of Vladimir Putin’s 2007 State
Address, arguing it signals a looming systemic crisis for Russia. It
frames the situation as a repetition of the 1970s Soviet experience –
characterized by reliance on oil revenues without genuine economic
development, leading to a “dictatorship of repair” rather than
sustainable growth.

The core argument is that Russia’s leadership is fundamentally incapable
of enacting meaningful reforms due to a deeply entrenched, corrupt elite
focused on extracting wealth rather than fostering development. This
elite, prioritizing short-term gains, is essentially managing the
country as a personal fiefdom, exacerbating existing problems like
demographic decline, crumbling infrastructure, and a lack of industrial
diversification.

The analysis highlights a critical lack of investment in Russia’s
future, with massive sums being diverted through capital flight and
wasteful projects. The author predicts a bleak future – a prolonged
period of stagnation and potential collapse – unless Russia can
fundamentally shift its leadership and embrace a truly transformative,
five-year plan approach. The text paints a picture of a country trapped
in a vicious cycle of resource dependence, corruption, and ultimately,
systemic failure.

This text is a fragmented, almost dreamlike recollection of a man’s
experience surrounding the sale of his mother’s house and the
surrounding land. It’s a story steeped in nostalgia, familial
relationships, and the enduring power of a place deeply connected to a
family’s history. The narrator recounts his mother’s fierce attachment
to the house, a place she lovingly referred to as “гнилушка,” and its
significance as a living entity rooted in the local community’s past. He
details her struggles to maintain the property, highlighting her
resourcefulness and the complex relationships she forged with neighbors
– the “дальнобойщики” and the “молочники” – each representing different
facets of rural life and human connection.

The narrative is characterized by a cyclical pattern of observation and
interaction, with the narrator repeatedly encountering the same
individuals and witnessing their evolving desires for the land. There’s
a sense of impending loss and the disruption of a cherished, albeit
imperfect, way of life. The story culminates in a final, poignant
encounter with the “молочник,” signifying the irreversible
transformation of the property and the end of a particular chapter in
the narrator’s life. The overall tone is melancholic, reflecting a deep
sense of attachment to a place and the inevitable passage of time.

Shadow of China over G8
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2007-05-15 - <b> Nikolay Konʹkov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text analyzes the emerging global geopolitical landscape in
mid-2007, characterized by a shift towards a “bipolar world” dominated
by two new centers of power: the “Atlantic” alliance (primarily the
United States and Europe) and a rising “Pacific” bloc led by China and
Japan. The core argument is that the world is transitioning from a Cold
War-era bipolarity to this new configuration, driven by key developments
like the US and EU’s “Atlantic Common Market” – a move away from
maintaining global dominance through traditional means.

The text highlights the rise of China and Japan as significant
competitors to the US, fueled by their economic growth and strategic
ambitions. It details specific events – the Belsky resignation, the
death of Yeltsin, the “Bronze Soldier” relocation, Ukrainian elections,
and the “March of Discontent” in St. Petersburg – as indicators of this
shift, framing them as deliberate attempts to destabilize Russia and
undermine its influence.

Furthermore, the analysis identifies a “Troika” of Western strategies
against Russia: attempting to economically isolate the country, fueling
social unrest, and disrupting its geopolitical influence. The author
suggests that Russia’s response must include strengthening ties with
Belarus, expanding its role within the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization, and strategically managing its energy resources. The text
concludes with a call for a thorough analysis of this new geopolitical
reality before the G8 summit in Germany, emphasizing the need for Russia
to proactively adapt to this changing global order.

<p>

This text, originally published in 2007, analyzes the concept of
“sovereign democracy” as it’s being presented by the Russian government.
It argues that the term is a deliberate attempt to create a new
ideological framework, masking a deeper concern: the loss of Russia’s
control over its natural resources, particularly oil and gas. The author
critiques the simplistic, market-driven approach promoted by figures
like Michael McDowell and Sergei Kozyrev, arguing that it ignores the
fundamental threats to Russia’s sovereignty posed by global economic
forces.

The core argument is that “sovereign democracy” is a rhetorical device
designed to deflect attention from the reality of Russia’s diminished
control over its economy and its strategic resources. The author
highlights the dangers of accepting a model where Russia’s economic
future is dictated by external actors, particularly the United States,
through mechanisms like the World Trade Organization and the
International Monetary Fund.

Ultimately, the text advocates for a Russia that prioritizes the
security and well-being of its people and its territory, rather than
blindly embracing a globalized economic order. It calls for a pragmatic
approach focused on strengthening Russia’s internal capabilities and
safeguarding its strategic interests, emphasizing the need to protect
its natural resources and maintain a degree of autonomy in shaping its
own destiny. The author stresses the importance of a “human capital”
investment strategy and a focus on social and economic stability as key
components of a truly sovereign and democratic Russia.

This text expresses strong opposition to a proposed redevelopment plan
for the Sergey Yesenin Museum-Reserve in Konstantinovo, Russia. The
plan, spearheaded by architect Valentin Gavrilov and supported by
regional officials, involves significant construction including a
massive 1300 square meter conference center (formerly intended as a
theater for the governor’s favored opera singer), a large entertainment
complex, and a gas station – all within the museum’s protected zone.
Critics argue this plan fundamentally violates the museum’s purpose as a
preservation site, threatens the landscape and ecological integrity of
the area, and represents a corrupting influence of tourism and personal
gain.

Key concerns include the potential for increased erosion due to
construction, the destruction of the natural landscape that inspired
Yesenin’s poetry, and the disregard for existing conservation efforts.
Numerous scientists, museum staff, and local figures have voiced their
opposition, citing legal violations, environmental damage, and a lack of
consideration for the historical and cultural significance of the site.
They argue that the project prioritizes short-term economic benefits
over the long-term preservation of a vital cultural heritage site, and
that the project is driven by the governor’s personal connections. The

dynamics in the region. It describes the stark landscape – the remnants
of military installations, the division of the Ma’aleh Shomron village,
and the impact of decades of conflict and occupation. The report
highlights the ongoing struggle for control of the Golan Heights,
emphasizing the intertwined histories of Israeli and Syrian forces, and

Crucially, the text analyzes the evolving influence of Syria,
particularly the rise of President Bashar al-Assad and his growing

Ultimately, the piece paints a picture of a region undergoing profound

The text is a lengthy, pessimistic analysis of the complex and fraught

attempts to forge a unified identity, a fundamental incompatibility
exists between the two nations, driven by competing ideological

the leadership of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) under Recep

principles and the guarantor of Kemalism, plays a significant role, with
the head of the General Staff, Mehmet Büyükanıt, actively intervening

This text details a complex and precarious situation surrounding
Vladimir Putin’s leadership and Russia’s relationship with the West in
early 2007. Putin is preparing to leave office in April 2008, a decision
driven by a desire to avoid a “new Cold War” and the potential for
international isolation. He’s facing a long list of disagreements with
the West, including issues like Kosovo, NATO expansion, energy disputes,
and accusations of corruption and terrorism.

To mitigate these risks, Putin is planning a visit to George W. Bush’s
family estate in Maine, hoping to negotiate compromises. However, a
significant portion of the Russian elite, deeply intertwined with
Western business and culture, fears this outcome and desires to avoid
becoming international outcasts.

Several key figures, including Boris Abramovich (likely referring to
Boris Berezovsky), Roman Abramovich, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, are seen
as potential levers for influence, though their actions and loyalties
are uncertain. The text highlights concerns about the security of Putin
and his associates, as well as the potential for Western legal action
against them.

Ultimately, the text portrays a situation where Putin is attempting to
navigate a delicate balance between Western demands and the desires of
his own powerful inner circle, all while facing significant risks and

Russia’s geopolitical position and the need for significant concessions
to avoid a worsening of relations with the West.

This text is a highly unusual and provocative analysis of geopolitical
strategy, framed as “org-weaponry.” It argues that Russia’s current
situation – particularly its perceived vulnerabilities – can be
understood through the lens of a deliberate, orchestrated campaign of
destabilization, similar to how “org-weaponry” is deployed.

Here’s a breakdown of the key arguments:

-   **The “Org-Weaponry” Framework:** The core idea is that Western
    powers aren’t simply pursuing a geopolitical agenda; they’re
    actively employing a sophisticated strategy of “org-weaponry” – a
    deliberate attempt to dismantle Russia’s political and economic
    systems through psychological manipulation, disinformation, and the
    exploitation of internal weaknesses.
-   **Identifying Key Sectors:** The text outlines 13 “sectors” of
    vulnerability within Russia, ranging from social and political
    instability to economic decay and technological stagnation. These
    sectors are presented as targets for strategic disruption.
-   **Strategic Manipulation:** The analysis suggests that Western
    powers are actively shaping these sectors to exacerbate Russia’s
    problems, creating a feedback loop of instability.
-   **The Role of Information:** The text emphasizes the importance of
    information warfare – the manipulation of public opinion and the
    spread of disinformation – as a key component of this strategy.
-   **A Pessimistic Outlook:** The overall tone is deeply pessimistic,
    portraying Russia as a nation already weakened and vulnerable to a
    calculated assault.

Essentially, the text presents a conspiracy-laden view of international
relations, arguing that Russia is a victim of a deliberate and sustained
campaign of destabilization orchestrated by external forces.

This text is a commentary and analysis, published in 2007, concerning a
proposed radical new approach to nuclear energy – Relativistic Heavy-Ion
Nuclear Energy (YRT). The core argument is that Russia, through the work
of scientists like Igor Ostretsov and Alexander Bogomolov, has developed
a technology capable of solving the world’s energy and nuclear waste
problems, fundamentally changing the landscape of nuclear power.

The piece highlights concerns about the current state of nuclear energy,
criticizing the reliance on uranium-235 and plutonium-239, and the
associated problems of waste disposal, reactor decommissioning, and the
potential for nuclear proliferation. It argues that YRT offers a safer,
more sustainable, and technologically advanced solution.

The author expresses skepticism about the current approach of many
governments and corporations, citing examples like the Los Alamos
National Laboratory’s mismanagement of nuclear resources and the
“take-it-or-leave-it” attitude towards scientific innovation.

Crucially, the text advocates for a shift in priorities, emphasizing the
importance of supporting and investing in scientific research,
particularly in Russia, and the need for a coordinated international
effort to develop and implement the YRT technology. It proposes the
creation of an international Moscow Club to facilitate this
collaboration. The author stresses that the development of YRT is not
just a technological solution, but a fundamental shift in how humanity
approaches energy and its relationship with the environment. The piece
concludes with a call to action, urging a move away from short-sighted,
profit-driven approaches and towards a long-term, scientifically-based

This text is a rambling, somewhat paranoid, and darkly humorous
reflection on identity, ancestry, and societal observation. It begins
with a recounted childhood memory of a visit to an aunt and her bathing
rituals, quickly spiraling into a critique of contemporary Russia and
its perceived anxieties about national identity. The author expresses a
suspicion of “experts” and commentators who attempt to define and
categorize Russians, framing them as “scrubbers” – individuals
obsessively seeking to identify and categorize others, particularly
those perceived as foreign or “other.”

The piece uses a series of rhetorical questions and absurd scenarios to
challenge the notion of fixed national identities, suggesting that
attempts to define oneself through ancestry or observation are
ultimately futile and driven by a desire to control and categorize
others. It employs a cynical tone, questioning the motives of those
offering interpretations of Russian identity and highlighting the

ultimately urges readers not to engage in this “scrubbing” but to
embrace their own identities and resist attempts to impose external
definitions. The text is a bizarre and unsettling commentary on the

This text details a significant, ambitious plan to revitalize and expand
Vladivostok, driven by Russia’s desire to strengthen its presence in the
Asia-Pacific region. The core of the project, dubbed “Large
Vladivostok,” involves a massive investment of approximately 100 billion
rubles, primarily focused on constructing infrastructure and housing to
accommodate a projected population increase of five to seven million
people.

The plan is spurred by the 2012 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
summit, intended to elevate Russia’s standing and attract foreign
investment and skilled workers through “Russian immigration.” Key
elements include building a new city on Russky Island, constructing a
bridge across Golden Horn Bay, developing a new transportation system,
and establishing a major port.

However, the text highlights potential challenges, including
difficulties in securing foreign investment for large-scale construction
projects and the need for local expertise to navigate bureaucratic
processes and understand regional nuances. It emphasizes the scale of
the undertaking and the importance of careful planning and execution to
avoid over-optimistic projections and ensure the project’s success. The
overall tone is cautiously optimistic, recognizing the immense task
ahead while underlining the strategic importance of the endeavor for
Russia’s future in the Asia-Pacific region.

This letter is a desperate plea from Tatiana Mironova, the mother of
Ivan Mironov, who is being held in pretrial detention and accused of
terrorism and other serious crimes related to an alleged attempted
assassination of Boris Mironov (her ex-husband, a former Minister of
Printing). Tatiana argues the charges are baseless, fabricated by
investigator Ivanov, and motivated by political pressure against her
family. She disputes the timeline of events, highlighting
inconsistencies and a lack of evidence. She points out that Ivan, a
respected historian, has no connection to the alleged crimes and that
the accusations are being used to harass her and her son. She questions
the legality of his detention, the lack of progress in the
investigation, and the potential for abuse of the legal system. She
requests a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding
Ivan’s arrest and detention, demanding his release and the cessation of
the criminal prosecution.

Here’s a summary of the provided text, focusing on the key arguments and
themes:

The text argues that Russia’s ambitious “technological leap” faces
significant obstacles, not just from external pressures but crucially
from internal divisions within the country. It identifies two primary
“fronts” of opposition: Western nations actively seeking to hinder
Russia’s progress through technological restrictions and propaganda, and
a corrupted and ideologically misaligned domestic elite.

The core argument is that Russia’s modernization hinges on fundamentally
transforming its leadership. This requires cultivating a new generation
of technocratic leaders genuinely committed to Russia’s industrial and
technological advancement, rather than clinging to outdated liberal or
capitalist ideologies. The text stresses the need for a shift in the
mindset of the ruling class, moving away from prioritizing Western
consumption and influence towards a national vision of industrial
strength and technological innovation.

Ultimately, the text frames the challenge as a battle for the soul of
Russia, arguing that without a genuine commitment to national
technological development, the “technological leap” will inevitably
fail.

This letter, dated July 11, 2007, is a strongly worded complaint
addressed to First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov regarding the
state of Russian aviation. The author, a chief designer from “Strymline

The text is an analysis of the writings of Israeli author Israel Shamir,
specifically his views on Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the
“Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” Shamir’s writings are presented as
historically revisionist and often bordering on antisemitic, focusing on
alleged Jewish conspiracies and portraying Palestinians as victims of
Jewish aggression. The analysis highlights Shamir’s claims about
historical events, such as the massacre at the “Prud of Mamilla” and the
alleged influence of “Protocols” on contemporary events. It also
examines Shamir’s perspective on the “Protocols” themselves, describing
them as a complex and potentially manipulative text. The text concludes
by asserting that Shamir’s views are rooted in a belief that Jewish
success is dependent on the failures of other nations, and that a
fundamental difference exists between Jews and “goyim” (non-Jews).

This article reviews the First Moscow Festival of Comic Opera, a six-day
event organized by the “Na Basmannoy” Comic Opera Theatre. The festival
showcased a diverse program of operas by Mozart, Donizetti, Offenbach,
and Kalman.

The theatre’s success is attributed to its youthful energy, the
performers’ bravery and desire to bring joy, and a willingness to
embrace diverse musical styles, even those outside of strictly classical
interpretations. Key performances included Mozart’s “The Marriage of
Figaro,” Donizetti’s “The Pirate King,” Offenbach’s “The Bat,” and
Kalman’s “The Violet of Montmartre.”

Several performers, particularly Boris Molchanov, were highlighted for
their talent and versatility. The author noted some shortcomings,
including an overly theatrical approach by the orchestra and the use of
microphones, which detracted from the music’s authenticity. The reviewer
expressed hope that the theatre would take these observations seriously.

This text argues that Zionism is fundamentally rooted in and fueled by
anti-Jewish sentiment, specifically stemming from classical Judaism’s
inherent prejudice against non-Jews. It contends that Zionist leaders,
including figures like Theodor Herzl and Joachim Prinz, actively
embraced and glorified Nazi ideology, seeing the defeat of liberalism
and the rise of the “Aryan race” as opportunities to solidify Jewish
identity and establish a racially pure state.

The text draws heavily on the work of Israeli historian Isaiah Shahak,
who argues that Zionism’s discrimination against Palestinians is based
on ancient Jewish beliefs of hatred and contempt for non-Jews. It
highlights how Zionist figures celebrated the rise of Nazism and the
suppression of liberal ideas, viewing it as a chance to establish a
nation based on racial purity.

The author uses historical examples, such as the collaboration between
Zionist leaders and anti-Semitic figures like граф Плеве and the
glorification of Nazi ideology by Joachim Prinz, to demonstrate a
consistent pattern of embracing prejudice and a desire for separation
based on religious and racial grounds. Shahak’s conclusions are
presented as a key justification for the ongoing discrimination against
Palestinians within Israel.

This text is a scathing critique of the contemporary Russian art scene,
particularly focusing on the career of Oleg Kulik and the broader trend
of “avant-garde” art in the 1990s and early 2000s. The author argues
that much of this art was performative, cynical, and ultimately devoid
of genuine meaning or social impact. Kulik, representing a “dog” figure
for the “global government,” exemplifies this trend – a hollow imitation
of relevance designed to appease Western curators and critics. The
author contends that this art was driven by a desire for recognition and
funding rather than by any sincere artistic vision. The rise of this
style coincided with a period of instability and social upheaval in
Russia, where artists prioritized shock value and provocation over
addressing real social issues. The author concludes that this entire
movement was a failed experiment, a “dog” that ultimately served only to
reflect and amplify the superficiality of the era. The text ends with a
dismissive farewell to Kulik and a pessimistic outlook for the future of
Russian art.

This text is a nostalgic and critical reflection on the suppression of
individual expression and creativity within a totalitarian system,
primarily drawing parallels to experiences of artists, intellectuals,
and workers in the Soviet Union. It recounts anecdotes about individuals
– poets, teachers, factory workers, and military personnel – who faced
pressure to conform to state dictates regarding their work, hobbies, and
even their personal beliefs. The narrative highlights instances where
creative pursuits were curtailed, ideas were censored, and personal
freedoms were restricted in the name of ideological purity and state
control. It uses specific examples – such as the rejection of a poet’s
work due to perceived ideological inconsistencies, the forced conformity
of workers in various professions, and the limitations placed on
teachers’ freedom of expression – to illustrate the broader theme of
stifled creativity and the denial of individual autonomy. The text
ultimately questions the nature of freedom and the potential for
societal control, contrasting the experiences of those who were granted
the “luxury” of pursuing personal passions with the constraints faced by
others, particularly those in positions of labor or creative endeavor.

The text is a lengthy, reflective piece recounting an experience at a
summer camp for boys, focused on themes of faith, Russia, and personal
transformation. The camp, located near Serguiev Posad, is led by a man
named Alexey, who acts as a central figure and embodies the spirit of
“Holy Russia.” The core of the narrative revolves around the boys’
growth – particularly Arthur and Arseny – through a combination of
physical challenges, spiritual reflection, and the camp’s unique
atmosphere.

The boys undergo a significant shift in their understanding of
themselves and their connection to Russia, moving beyond a purely
chronological age to one defined by their spiritual development and acts
of kindness. The camp’s setting, with its campfire and connection to the
monastery, is crucial to this process.

Alexey emphasizes the importance of embracing a “Holy Russia,” not just
geographically but spiritually, and the boys’ experiences mirror this
ideal. The narrative is filled with symbolism – the campfire, the
guitar, the boys’ physical struggles, and their creative writing – all
contributing to a powerful meditation on faith, identity, and the
enduring spirit of Russia. The boys’ individual transformations,
represented by their distinct responses to the camp’s challenges,
ultimately highlight the enduring power of belief and the possibility of

</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing, highly critical, and largely fictionalized
account of the governorship of Konstantin Tyotov in Samara, Russia, from
1991-2007. It paints a picture of rampant corruption, mismanagement, and
wasteful spending by Tyotov and his associates, fueled by a combination
of grand schemes, outright fraud, and a general disregard for public
funds.

The core argument is that Tyotov’s tenure was marked by a series of
disastrous projects – including massive investments in unproductive
ventures like the “three-ton turkey” farm, a sugar factory, a dairy
farm, and a fraudulent automobile factory – all designed to impress the
President and the public, but ultimately resulting in the loss of
hundreds of millions of rubles. These projects were consistently plagued
by fraud, manipulation, and the involvement of corrupt officials,
including Tyotov himself, his associates, and figures like Boris
Abramovich and Alexei Tyotov.

The text details a pattern of deception, using fabricated documents and
exploiting loopholes to siphon money from the budget. It highlights the
involvement of law enforcement agencies, including the General
Prosecutor’s Office and the Samara City Police Department, which were
often complicit in the corruption.

A particularly bizarre and memorable element is the description of a
blue, truncated, phallic-shaped structure – the Samara train station
dome – built as a final, mocking gesture by Tyotov.

Ultimately, the text portrays Tyotov’s governorship as a symbol of
systemic corruption and a profound failure of governance, leaving behind
a legacy of economic devastation and public outrage.

Thirteenth Apostle

2007-09-11 - <b> Yevgeniy Golovin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text explores the evolution of Vladimir Mayakovsky’s poetic thought
and practice, particularly during the early years of the Soviet state.
Initially, Mayakovsky embraced a deliberately provocative and jarring
style, responding to the perceived outdatedness of traditional art and
advocating for a revolutionary aesthetic – exemplified by his poem
“Cloud in Trousers.” He saw art as a tool for driving societal change,
influenced by the urgency of the Bolshevik cause. However, he quickly
recognized the need for art to be aligned with the state’s agenda,
leading to a shift in his approach.

He initially believed that poetry should be a direct, forceful
instrument for social transformation, mirroring the demands of the
revolution. He famously argued that poets should be “apostles” –
foretelling and driving the revolution. However, he soon realized the
importance of a “social order” for his poetry, explicitly writing for
the Communist Party and its goals of proletarian victory.

This led to a more pragmatic and didactic style, as seen in his critique
of Sergei Yesenin’s poetry, where he emphasized the importance of
disciplined labor and a rejection of individualistic sentimentality.
Mayakovsky believed that art should be a tool for shaping the collective
consciousness, prioritizing the needs of the working class and the state
over individual artistic expression. He saw the role of the poet as a
“prophet,” guiding the masses towards a new, socialist reality.
Ultimately, the text highlights Mayakovsky’s journey from a radical,
avant-garde artist to a state-sponsored poet, reflecting the broader
ideological shifts within the Soviet Union.

This article, published in “Soyuznoe Gosudarstvo” magazine in September
2007, discusses the stalled progress of the Union State between Russia
and Belarus. The author, Ivan Makushok, argues that despite ongoing
discussions and agreements, the creation of a fully functioning Union
State remains elusive due to a complex interplay of factors, including
differing political priorities, historical legacies, and external
pressures.

Makushok highlights the significant challenges, such as unresolved
issues regarding a common currency, the distribution of power within the
Union, and the differing perspectives of key figures like Presidents
Putin and Lukashenko. He acknowledges the strong desire for unity among
the populations and elites of both countries but stresses the need for a
pragmatic and sustained effort to overcome obstacles.

The article emphasizes the importance of continued dialogue and
collaboration between Russian and Belarusian officials, businesses, and
public figures, as reflected in the magazine’s own platform. It suggests
that while a “dead season” in integration has emerged, the magazine’s
role is to document and promote the ongoing discussion and ultimately,
the eventual realization of a strong Union State. The author expresses
hope that the momentum will be renewed, particularly as the 2008 Russian
presidential elections approach.

This text outlines a potential future scenario presented by Republican
presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani. He advocates for a significant
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to include
countries like Israel, Japan, Australia, India, and Singapore,
effectively transforming it into a global alliance. Giuliani’s proposal
is driven by a perceived shift towards a new bi-polar world order
dominated by the United States and China, with a focus on countering
China, radical Islamic movements (both Sunni and Shia), and
authoritarian Muslim regimes.

The text argues that Giuliani’s vision reflects a continuation of “clash
of civilizations” thinking and is fueled by the interests of powerful
energy and military corporations. It highlights potential challenges for
Russia, suggesting a limited range of options – NATO membership or
absorption by China – and emphasizes the need for Russia to maintain
internal unity and economic strength to avoid becoming a battleground
between these global powers. The author concludes that Russia’s future
depends on its ability to navigate complex relationships with both the

This text is a scathing critique of the Russian government’s handling of

author expresses deep frustration with the government’s inaction,
highlighting a fourteen-year delay in approving a memorial to the

citizens to fund the project.

The piece argues that the government’s response is cynical and

criticizes the lack of material support offered to these families,

The author expresses skepticism about the motivations of political
figures who now pay lip service to the memory of the victims, suggesting
they are primarily driven by political expediency rather than genuine

memory and honoring the sacrifices of those who died, framing it as a
fundamental moral obligation. It concludes with a call for the memorial

The text is a bleak, symbolic poem titled “Forever Crimson Presnya” by

</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy interview with Nikolai Volchanovsky, a Soviet
inventor and patent expert, reflecting on the state of innovation in
Russia and offering solutions to revitalize it. Volchanovsky argues that
a key impediment to Soviet innovation was a bureaucratic system that
undervalued and stifled inventive activity, particularly in the post-war
period. He criticizes the focus of state agencies on “fundamental
discoveries” rather than practical improvements and the lack of
incentives for inventors.

Volchanovsky proposes a radical overhaul of the patent system,
advocating for a mass inventors’ union with significant financial
incentives, a system of objective state expert review, and a
restructuring of Rospatent to operate more independently and
effectively. He believes that by removing bureaucratic obstacles and
fostering a competitive environment, Russia could achieve a “miracle” in
its economy through increased innovation. He expresses skepticism about
recent government pronouncements regarding scientific and technological
progress, suggesting that genuine change requires fundamental systemic
reform, not just rhetoric. The interview concludes with a call for
immediate action to unlock Russia’s potential for inventive growth.

Spirit mobilizatio

<p>
2007-10-16 - <b> Maksim Shevchenko </b>
</p>
<p>

This text discusses the core of Russian history and national identity,
arguing that Russia’s progress has always stemmed from moments of
profound spiritual mobilization – periods where intellectuals and a
“thinking layer” (rather than the state or popular masses) united around
a central, original idea. The author contends that Russia’s historical
failures – like the Bolshevik project and attempts at industrialization
based on Western socialist models – resulted from a lack of this genuine
spiritual drive.

Key points include the importance of a “thinking layer” as the true
foundation of Russian society, the dangers of imposing foreign
ideological models, and the need for a uniquely Russian approach to
social and political organization. The author highlights the 1941 “Not
One Step Back!” order as an example of this mobilization, and suggests
that the Soviet Union’s initial structure – a “world commune” based on
individual freedom and private property – represented the closest Russia
has come to realizing its potential. Ultimately, the text argues that
Russia’s survival depends on maintaining this organic,
spiritually-driven national identity, rather than relying on external
influences or state-led projects.

POTATO REBELLION
</h3>

<p>
2007-10-16 - <b> Vladimir Bushin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, somewhat rambling reflection on the poetry of
Osip Mandelstam, primarily through the lens of Emma Gershtein’s
“Memoirs.” It’s a critical examination of Mandelstam’s work,
particularly his 1930s poems, and how they were interpreted and debated
by various literary figures, including Mandelstam himself, Lev Gumilev,
and Vladimir Tvarovsky.

The core argument is that Mandelstam’s poetry is notoriously difficult
to understand, often due to its complex imagery, allusions, and the
poet’s deliberately obscured intentions. Gershtein highlights the
debates surrounding specific images and phrases, such as the “tramway
cherry” and the “curved Moscow,” demonstrating how different critics
offered varying interpretations, often based on their own biases and
understandings.

The text repeatedly emphasizes the subjective nature of interpretation,
noting that even the most astute critics struggled to grasp Mandelstam’s
meaning. It’s a critique of the tendency to impose one’s own
understanding onto a poet’s work, and a recognition that true
understanding can only come from within the poet’s own mind. Ultimately,
the piece suggests that Mandelstam’s poetry is a deliberately enigmatic
and challenging work, designed to resist easy interpretation.

certificate for their child. Despite presenting birth certificates and
the marriage certificate, which already included the nationality of

This text is an interview with Igor Ostretsov, a specialist in nuclear
energy, discussing critical issues facing the world’s energy future. He
argues that the key to humanity’s survival lies in developing nuclear
energy based on the controlled use of uranium-238, rather than relying
on dwindling supplies of uranium-235.

Ostretsov highlights a “energy cross” – the point where organic fuel
supplies will be insufficient to meet global demand, likely around 2010.
He stresses the importance of the Protvino accelerator facility,
currently underutilized, as the only place in the world where the
technology to efficiently utilize uranium-238 for energy production can
be developed.

He proposes the creation of the “Moscow Energy Club,” led by President
Putin, to foster international collaboration in nuclear energy research
and development, particularly with countries in Southeast Asia, the
Middle East, and Latin America. Ostretsov believes this club is crucial
for humanity’s survival, given the limitations of uranium-235 and the
need for a globally coordinated approach to energy production. He
emphasizes the urgency of this situation and the potential catastrophic

is based on a bizarre and ultimately detrimental decision by President
Putin – to appoint a furniture maker and customs official – suggesting a
deliberate attempt to diminish the importance of the General Staff. The
author details a history of mismanagement and incompetence under

</p>
<p>
This text analyzes the growing public demand for Vladimir Putin to
remain in power, framing it as a deeply rooted anxiety within the
Russian population. It argues that this demand stems from a pervasive
sense of impending disaster – fears of economic collapse, societal
disintegration, and external threats (Germans, Chinese, Turks). Putin’s
perceived role is that of a “spiritual leader,” a “Father of the
Nation,” invoked to prevent this catastrophe, mirroring the historical
figure of Stalin. However, the author questions whether Putin truly
understands or responds to this deep-seated fear, suggesting external
forces – perhaps a loss of instinct for self-preservation or
manipulative rhetoric – are preventing him from fulfilling this role.
The text paints a picture of a dangerous situation where Putin’s
authority is built on a fragile, almost mystical, foundation, vulnerable
to disillusionment and ultimately, destruction. It highlights the
potential for a catastrophic backlash if Putin were to step down,
portraying it as a betrayal and a trigger for a series of devastating
events, fueled by external enemies and internal divisions.

evaporate, leading to widespread condemnation. Furthermore, the text
argues that powerful figures like oligarchs and neighboring countries

This text is a conversation between Mikhail Zinov’yev and Mikhail
Yur’ev, discussing the future of Russia and the United States. Zinov’yev
expresses skepticism about optimistic predictions for Russia’s
dominance, while Yur’ev argues for a revolutionary shift in Russian
society – a “new class” – focused on distinct values rather than simply
copying Western models.

Yur’ev believes Russia’s future depends on avoiding the mistakes of the
past, particularly the reliance on a consumerist, Western-influenced
society. He sees America’s current state – a systemic crisis fueled by
excessive debt and a flawed financial system – as a significant threat.

He predicts a future where Russia, with a strong, focused society, will
likely emerge as one of the world’s leading powers, potentially
alongside the United States. However, he anticipates a conflict with
America driven by America’s own systemic problems and Russia’s
determined resistance. Ultimately, Yur’ev believes Russia’s success
hinges on a fundamental transformation of its values and social
structure, a “revolution from above” rather than a gradual evolution.

Sergei Glaziev, through the “Zavtra” publication, outlines a critical
assessment of Russia’s economic situation and proposes a series of
urgent reforms. He argues that the country’s reliance on the US dollar,
stemming from past miscalculations and a failure to anticipate the
collapse of the dollar-based global financial system, has led to
significant economic vulnerabilities.

Glaziev believes the key is a rapid shift away from the dollar and
towards a more diversified international financial system, with the
ruble playing a greater role. He advocates for immediately moving
foreign currency reserves into alternative assets like gold and precious
metals, increasing trade in rubles with neighboring countries and the
EU, and fundamentally reforming the central bank’s monetary policy –
moving away from controlling money supply and towards a flexible
approach based on market demand.

He criticizes the current leadership’s “dollar fetishism,” attributing
it to short-sightedness and incompetence. He suggests implementing
measures like a temporary ruble exchange rate fix during a transition
period, imposing tariffs on subsidized imports, and strengthening the
Russian economy through technological development and expanded trade
partnerships. Ultimately, Glaziev contends that a fundamental change in

</p>
<p>

This text is a complex analysis of Russia’s relationship with the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and the broader global economic landscape,
particularly in 2007. It argues that Russia’s entry into the WTO is not
simply a matter of economic integration, but a strategic necessity
driven by a collapsing global financial system and the perceived
pressure from Western powers, particularly the United States and the UK.

The core argument is that the world is experiencing a major crisis,
potentially leading to the collapse of the current dollar-based
financial system. Western leaders, notably the UK’s Prime Minister, are
actively pushing for Russia’s WTO membership as a way to stabilize the
global economy and maintain Western influence. However, the text
highlights a significant shift in perspective, with prominent figures
like Oleg Vygunin, a long-time advocate of Western-style economic
policies, now acknowledging the urgency of Russia’s WTO entry.

The analysis details a series of interconnected events and pressures:
the UK’s announcement of structural changes in global trade, the
perceived reluctance of the EU to address agricultural subsidies, the
US’s insistence on Russia’s inclusion in the WTO, and the ongoing
tensions surrounding the Russian currency and financial system. It
suggests that Russia’s strategic goal is to navigate this crisis,
potentially emerging as a key player in a restructured global economy,
rather than passively accepting a role dictated by Western powers. The
text ultimately portrays a situation where Russia’s entry into the WTO
is not just an economic decision, but a crucial step in securing its

This text is a detailed review and analysis of Gennady Smolin’s book,
“Genius and Villainy,” which investigates the death of Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart. The reviewer initially expresses skepticism about Smolin’s
approach, noting a somewhat sensationalist style. However, they
ultimately commend the book for its thorough research and compelling
arguments, particularly regarding the evidence of Mozart’s poisoning.

The core of the review centers on the scientific confirmation of
rutenium poisoning, achieved through neutron activation analysis of
Mozart’s hair samples. The reviewer highlights the meticulous timeline
of poisoning, identified through Smolin’s research, and the significant
concentration of rutenium found in Mozart’s hair – far exceeding normal
levels. They emphasize the importance of this scientific validation,
correcting a long-standing historical narrative.

The reviewer also discusses the context of Mozart’s death, examining the
involvement of figures like Franz Xaver Süssmayr, Leopold II, and the
potential motives behind the poisoning. They connect Mozart’s death to a
broader pattern of suppression and the silencing of dissenting voices,
drawing parallels to the treatment of Pushkin and Lermontov.

Finally, the reviewer concludes with a poignant reflection on the legacy
of Mozart, urging readers to appreciate the depth and beauty of his
music while acknowledging the tragic circumstances of his premature
death and the need to protect creative geniuses from exploitation and
harm.
