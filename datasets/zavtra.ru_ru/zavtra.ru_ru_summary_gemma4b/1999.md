CHONBISM AS A STYLE
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1999-01-03 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This lengthy article, published in 1999, expresses deep concern about
the state of architecture in Moscow and, more broadly, the decline of
artistic and architectural values within the city. The author argues
that Moscow has suffered a dramatic shift away from thoughtful,
historically-rooted design towards a superficial, trend-driven
aesthetic, largely fueled by commercial interests and a lack of genuine
architectural expertise.

The core of the critique centers on a perceived abandonment of
fundamental principles – composition, scale, proportion, and the
importance of considering the overall urban fabric. The rise of “design”
– characterized by a focus on “attractiveness” rather than “beauty,” and
a willingness to prioritize novelty and spectacle over enduring quality
– is seen as a destructive force.

The author laments the dominance of a “snoozy” architectural scene,
where architects are more concerned with adhering to current trends and
pleasing wealthy clients, rather than engaging in serious, considered
design. The rise of “Moscow-City” is viewed as a particularly egregious
example of this trend, a purely commercial development lacking any
connection to the city’s historical and architectural identity.

Ultimately, the piece portrays a crisis in the profession, with a
demoralized and financially strained architectural community struggling
to maintain its artistic integrity amidst a system prioritizing profit
and superficiality. The author calls for a renewed commitment to the
legacy of great Russian architects and a return to fundamental
principles of design, suggesting that the profession must “recover” from
this “illness” and “return to health.”

</h3>
</a>
<p>
1999-01-11 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing, almost mythical, condemnation of Eduard
Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister and first president of
independent Georgia. It portrays him as a brutal, manipulative, and
ultimately destructive figure who plunged Georgia into chaos and
devastation following his rise to power.

The piece uses vivid, almost grotesque imagery to depict Shevardnadze’s
appearance and actions, emphasizing his paranoia, cruelty, and inability
to understand or govern effectively. It suggests he was driven by a
deep-seated hatred of the Soviet Union and a desire to cling to power at
any cost, resulting in widespread violence, ethnic conflict, and the
economic ruin of the country.

The narrative frames Shevardnadze as a “vampire,” a “monster,” and a
“wretched” figure, fueled by a pathological need for control and a
complete disregard for the well-being of his people. The text argues
that his actions were not strategic or visionary, but rather the product
of a fundamentally flawed and destructive personality. It concludes with
a bleak prophecy of his inevitable demise, suggesting a fate mirroring
his actions – a violent and ignominious end.

This text alleges a significant and ongoing influence of American
intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA, within Russia. It argues
that instead of directly funding political parties or manipulating the
government, the US has established independent financial institutions
(like “Most Bank”) to exert control through media influence, support of
political movements (such as “Yabloko”), and the enrichment of key
figures within the Russian political and economic landscape. The text
suggests that these institutions, funded by US intelligence, actively
promote US interests, including influencing policy decisions regarding
Iraq, the Kuril Islands, and the Russian currency, while simultaneously
exploiting the vulnerabilities of Russian political actors and
institutions. The author posits that the focus of US intelligence
efforts has shifted from directly supporting anti-Soviet dissidents to
leveraging former KGB officers and figures from the post-Soviet era. The
text concludes that US intelligence agencies are effectively siphoning
funds from Russian banks and institutions, often without direct
oversight from US authorities, and that investigations into Russian
organized crime are misdirected, failing to uncover the true extent of
this influence.

WHITE GLOVES PRIMAK
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1999-01-25 - <b> Aleksey Gordeyev </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the Russian government under Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and, more broadly, of the post-Soviet
economic and political situation in the 1990s. It argues that the
“liberal reforms” implemented by figures like Yavlinsky and Gaidar led
to a corrupt and incompetent regime that exacerbated economic problems,
including massive debt, the collapse of industry, and social inequality.
The author contends that the government engaged in a deliberate
manipulation of the economy, prioritizing personal enrichment over
national interests.

The core argument is that the government, under Chernomyrdin,
essentially acted as a group of incompetent clowns, facilitating a
“criminal Panama” and engaging in a systematic dismantling of the
Russian economy. The author highlights the government’s failure to
address critical issues like the national debt, the sale of state
assets, and the decline in living standards.

The text proposes a shift in Russia’s foreign policy, advocating for a
more assertive role in the international arena, particularly through
partnerships with China and India, and a re-evaluation of relationships
with Western countries. It suggests a focus on economic cooperation
within the “ruble space” and a renewed emphasis on protecting the rights
of Russian speakers abroad. Ultimately, the author argues that Russia
needs to embrace its strength and assert itself on the world stage,
rather than passively accepting the dictates of the “international
community.”

1999-01-25 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a 1999 opinion piece from the Serbian newspaper “Vesti,”
offering a highly critical and nationalistic perspective on Serbia,
Yugoslavia, and the surrounding geopolitical situation. The author,
Valentin Zrubin, expresses deep distrust of Western powers, particularly
the United States, and paints a bleak picture of Serbia under Slobodan
Milošević.

The piece argues that Milošević, despite some positive actions like
promoting multi-party democracy and preventing a genocide, is ultimately
a pawn of Western interests. It criticizes the influence of foreign
actors like the Soros Foundation, Western academics (specifically
mentioning “agent influence” from Germany), and international
organizations like the Red Cross.

The author highlights perceived Western manipulation through figures
like the Bosnian Republic’s leadership and the influence of foreign aid.
He expresses concern about the potential for Western “democrats” to
destabilize Serbia and emphasizes the ongoing struggle against
“international communism.”

The text portrays Serbia as a victim of external forces, highlighting
the suffering of the Serbian people and the ongoing challenges they
face. It emphasizes Serbian national pride and resistance against
perceived threats. The piece also details specific events and figures,
including the impact of NATO bombing, the displacement of Serbs, and the
role of various international organizations. It concludes with a
pessimistic outlook for Serbia and a call for continued resistance.

This text is a remembrance of Nikolai Starshinov, a poet who lived from
1924 to 1998. It details his life, from his wartime service as a machine
gunner to his long career as an editor and mentor to young poets.
Starshinov was portrayed as a man of integrity, deeply patriotic and
devoted to his craft, often helping young poets and providing for them
despite his own modest circumstances. The piece contrasts Starshinov’s
values with the perceived corruption and materialism of contemporary
society, highlighting his dedication to artistic pursuits and his
rejection of transactional relationships. Notably, the text concludes
with a poignant excerpt from one of Starshinov’s poems, emphasizing the
soldiers’ unwavering commitment to their duty, and a final, stark
statement: “Here, nothing is bought and nothing is sold.”

1999-02-01 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text recounts the experiences of border guards stationed at the
border crossing between Russia and Finland, specifically near the town
of Выборг. The story focuses on the routine work of patrolling the
border, dealing with various types of travelers – including “weekend
tourists” who frequently cross for drinking and leisure, and more
concerning, illegal immigrants from Africa, Asia, and other countries
seeking opportunities in the West.

The narrative highlights the challenges faced by the guards, such as
managing the influx of tourists and dealing with potential smuggling. It
emphasizes the guards’ dedication and professionalism, portraying them
as a resilient and somewhat nostalgic group, particularly regarding the
prospect of a more respected and rewarding military service. The story
also touches upon the historical context of the border, referencing the
“ Mannerheim Line” and the legacy of the Finnish general Mannerheim, and
the ongoing, albeit peaceful, relationship between the two countries.
The final segment introduces a humorous anecdote about a guard
encountering a heavily intoxicated tourist, illustrating the relaxed and
occasionally absurd nature of border control.

tumultuous period of perestroika, began to undermine the values and
ideals associated with their iconic roles. These actors, once revered as
national symbols, exploited their popularity to criticize the Soviet
system and promote liberal values, causing significant disillusionment
among the public. The text highlights specific examples, such as Mikhail
Ulyanov’s portrayal of Marshal Zhukov, and emphasizes the profound
damage done to the values established by Soviet cinema. While
acknowledging some actors remained loyal, the overall sentiment is one

world driven by competition for dwindling non-renewable resources,
particularly focusing on Russia’s strategic importance. The West views
Russia’s pursuit of independence as a challenge and is preparing for
future conflicts through initiatives like the global missile defense
system and China’s military buildup. The author argues that Russia’s
current leadership, a “ comprador” regime, is actively undermining
national interests and supporting Western policies. Ultimately, the
author concludes that a genuine “mobilization project” and Russia’s
self-sufficiency “Big Project” can only be achieved with a change in

<p>

This text is a passionate and critical reflection by Nikolai Kondratenko
on the state of Russia, particularly focusing on the challenges facing
the country in the 1990s. Kondratenko expresses deep concern about the
direction of Russia, attributing it to a combination of factors
including demographic decline, economic mismanagement, and deliberate
manipulation by external forces.

He argues that a key issue is the “weakness” of the post-war generation,
exacerbated by a significant population decrease following World War II.
This demographic vulnerability, he believes, was exploited by forces
seeking to sow discord and undermine national unity.

A central theme is the deliberate spread of anti-Semitic sentiment,
which Kondratenko views as a calculated tactic to distract from deeper
problems and create division. He details a specific incident involving a
foiled terrorist plot and the subsequent manipulation of public opinion.

Kondratenko criticizes the economic policies of the time, particularly
the raising of energy prices, which he believes crippled domestic
industry and fostered a culture of dependency. He expresses frustration
with the media’s role in perpetuating misinformation and fueling
anti-Russian sentiment.

Ultimately, Kondratenko delivers a warning about the dangers of
complacency and the importance of recognizing and combating manipulative
forces, urging a return to traditional values and a focus on national
unity.

This text presents a critical analysis of the media coverage surrounding
the NATO intervention in Yugoslavia, specifically focusing on the role
of online media and figures like Gleb Pavlovsky. Pavlovsky, operating
through his website Gazeta.Ru, is portrayed as a key agent disseminating
pro-NATO propaganda and fabricating information to manipulate public

minimizing the human cost of the conflict. It highlights Pavlovsky’s
role in shaping the online discourse, framing the conflict as a
legitimate NATO operation and dismissing reports of Serbian atrocities.
The text calls for a boycott of Pavlovsky’s website and urges the FSB to
expose him and other suspected agents of American intelligence operating
within Russian media outlets. Essentially, the text argues that a

<p>

This text is a recounting of a journalist’s experience after publishing
a controversial article about Grigoryev and the Bukharin affair. The
author, Alexander Roslyakov, describes being silenced by the editor of
“Independent Gazette,” Vitaly Tretyakov, after the article gained
attention and sparked a wider debate. The article was initially
perceived as a critique of Boris Yeltsin, fueled by the machinations of
oligarchs like Boris Березовский.

The piece details a complex web of intrigue involving Tretyakov, the
media, and ultimately, the manipulation of public opinion. Roslyakov’s
article triggered a significant backlash, with accusations of paranoia,
historical distortion, and even a conspiracy against Yeltsin. The
ensuing controversy involved prominent figures like Stephen Cohen and
Richard Kosolapov, who became involved in the debate.

Ultimately, the author suggests that the article was deliberately used
as a tool to discredit Yeltsin and expose a perceived conspiracy. The
entire episode was framed as a battle between competing narratives, with
the media playing a central role in shaping public perception. The
author concludes by suggesting that the entire affair was orchestrated

This text, dated April 20, 1999, analyzes the attempted impeachment of
President Yeltsin and the role of the Communist Party of the Russian
Federation (CPR). The CPR’s strategy centered on preventing Yeltsin’s
removal, securing the position of the Prosecutor General (Sкуратов), and
gaining advantageous positions in the upcoming parliamentary elections.
The authors argue that despite the chaotic “vertical” of power under
Yeltsin and the influence of Western financial institutions, the CPR,
aided by Prime Minister Priimak and a “nomenclature guard,” was
successfully maintaining the status quo. They believe the CPR’s focus on
the impeachment process and the potential prosecution of figures like
Scuratov, alongside issues like the Yugoslav conflict and election
fraud, would ultimately secure their success in the upcoming elections,
even if those elections were overshadowed by broader geopolitical events
like the NATO intervention in Yugoslavia. The text suggests the CPR’s
actions were not driven by ideological motives, but rather a pragmatic
attempt to maintain power and influence within the Russian political
landscape.

The text outlines a critical situation surrounding the potential removal
of Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov from his position in Russia. While
the upper chamber of parliament, the Federation Council, appeared to
initially support his dismissal, President Yeltsin skillfully
manipulated the situation. He offered a “test of loyalty” to the
senators – if they were themselves corrupt and uninterested in
challenging the regime, they should remove Skuratov. Simultaneously,
Yeltsin used intimidation (threatening to use the police and FSB) and
incentives (promises of assistance and special privileges) to ensure the
senators remained compliant. The core issue revolves around whether the
Federation Council would actively investigate corruption within the
government, or whether it would simply uphold the existing, deeply
corrupt regime, as dictated by Western financial interests and Yeltsin’s
administration.

HOMO-POTATOUS
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1999-05-10 - <b> Aleksandr Lyskov </b>
</p>
<p>

The text is a long, rambling, and surreal narrative set in a small,
rural Russian town named Petrovskaya in 1999. It’s a
stream-of-consciousness piece centered around a writer, Alexander
Lyskov, observing the lives of the town’s inhabitants, primarily
focusing on the rhythms of agricultural life and the peculiar characters
who inhabit it.

The story unfolds through Lyskov’s observations, detailing the daily
routines of farmers, including the elderly veteran Eugene
Konstantinovich and the former NKVD officer, Igor Vasilyevich, as they
work the land. He describes their routines, their eccentricities, and
their interactions with each other and with the younger generation.

The narrative is filled with digressions, historical references
(particularly from the 1920s), and philosophical musings on life, death,
and the cyclical nature of rural existence. It’s characterized by a
dreamlike quality, blending realism with fantastical elements and a
strong sense of place. The story culminates in Lyskov’s own reflections
on his role as a writer and his connection to the land and its people,
ending with a final, almost ritualistic, entry in his imagined journal.

On May 1st, 1999, in the village of Komarovo, Krasnoyarsk Krai, a group
of eight men in military-style camouflage shot at a water tower
displaying a red flag commemorating Victory Day. The group, including a
twelve-year-old boy with a rifle, began firing indiscriminately at the
tower, the surrounding trees, and even a group of children collecting
birch sap. The incident sparked fear and anger among the villagers, with
some fearing a potential uprising. The group, seemingly fixated on the
red flag, eventually fled, pursued by the villagers and later by a
police force that collected spent cartridges and removed the damaged
flag. The author expresses a strong sense of outrage and predicts a
severe consequence for those responsible, highlighting the potential for
violence fueled by anti-Soviet sentiment.

The text details a complex and highly speculative narrative surrounding
the death of American journalist Paul Teitman, who was murdered in
Russia in 1997. It alleges that Teitman possessed compromising video
footage of prominent Russian figures, including government officials and
celebrities, and that this footage led to his assassination by a
professional hit squad, possibly with the tacit approval of the US
intelligence community.

The narrative centers on a conspiracy involving American intelligence
agencies (specifically the CIA), Russian criminal networks, and
influential figures within the Russian government and media. It suggests
that Teitman was attempting to leverage the video footage for personal
gain, leading to a power struggle and his eventual demise.

The text repeatedly references a network of illicit activities,
including the use of a hotel (Rédhisson-Lazurnaya) as a hub for
gathering compromising information, the involvement of figures like Yuri
Skuratov and Pavel Gusev, and the manipulation of the Russian media
landscape. It paints a picture of a deeply corrupt system where powerful
individuals were protected by a combination of intimidation, blackmail,
and violence. The text ultimately portrays a scenario where Teitman was
a victim of this system, caught in a web of intrigue and silenced for
attempting to expose it.

This transcript is an interview with Mikhail Beskhmelnitsyn, a candidate
for a regional post in the Belgorod region of Russia. He expresses
frustration with the Supreme Court’s decision to cancel elections due to
a previous, contested decision by the regional Duma to postpone them.
Beskhmelnitsyn believes the postponement was orchestrated to benefit the
incumbent administration and views the situation as part of a broader
strategy to undermine the Communist Party.

He is continuing his campaign despite the legal challenges and intends
to challenge the validity of the elections, anticipating significant
expenses. He highlights the importance of grassroots support and
emphasizes the need to maintain unity among his supporters, particularly
in the face of potential divisions within the Communist Party and
external interference.

Beskhmelnitsyn criticizes the region’s substantial debt (260 million
dollars) and pledges to investigate its use, holding creditors
accountable. He also outlines a strategy for rebuilding the economy,
emphasizing efficiency and transparency, and expresses concerns about
potential corruption within the administration. He intends to build a
strong, professional team, prioritizing competence and eliminating
“spare runways” (potential sources of corruption). He anticipates a
complex and potentially contentious relationship with creditors and
believes the situation is part of a deliberate strategy to destabilize
the region and the Communist Party.

Noël Goden, a Belgian writer, orchestrated a campaign of “cream warfare”
targeting prominent figures he deemed responsible for the Yugoslavian
conflict and broader societal issues. From 1969 onwards, he and his
“cream army” – comprised of activists – hurled cream cakes at figures
including Margaret Thatcher, Bill Gates, Milton Friedman, and others he
viewed as symbols of capitalist excess and corruption. These actions
were not acts of terrorism, but rather a form of symbolic protest, aimed
at disrupting the image and influence of these individuals. Goden and
his followers believed that these figures were beyond legitimate censure
due to their perceived pro-establishment affiliations. The campaign
evolved into a complex operation involving coordinated attacks,
surveillance, and the recruitment of young activists. Despite the
absurdity of the actions, Goden maintained that they represented a
genuine attempt to challenge power structures and expose corruption,
often framing the targets as responsible for broader societal ills like
environmental damage and economic collapse.

<p>

This text recounts a sensitive and potentially damaging incident
involving Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow, involving a seemingly careless
remark made during a television appearance. The Patriarch, referring to
Red Square, suggested it had become a graveyard due to the presence of
both Lenin’s remains and other sacred relics. This sparked considerable
outrage and accusations, fueled by a desire to discredit the Orthodox
Church and, by extension, the legacy of the former Soviet Union.

The author expresses deep concern about the potential for manipulation
and division, highlighting how easily public opinion can be swayed and
how vulnerable the Russian public appears to be to provocations. He
emphasizes the importance of discernment and unity, particularly in the
face of external threats and internal discord. The author laments the
tendency to immediately blame the Church and to exacerbate tensions,
drawing parallels to the situation in Yugoslavia and urging a more
rational and compassionate approach. He stresses the need to recognize
the shared suffering of all Russians, regardless of political
affiliation, and to avoid falling into the trap of simplistic
scapegoating. The text concludes with a plea for understanding, a
reminder of the importance of spiritual reflection, and a warning
against allowing divisive rhetoric to undermine national unity.

Tadmoury discusses the resurgence of conflict, fueled by Israeli actions

This text is a firsthand account of a trip to Kosovo and Metohija in
June 1999, documenting the ongoing conflict and the experiences of those
living through it. The author, along with a group of Russians, traveled
to observe the situation and witness the impact of the NATO bombing and
the fighting between Serbian forces and Albanian militants (AOZ).

The journey reveals a stark and unsettling reality: a war-torn
landscape, widespread destruction, and a population struggling with
shortages, displacement, and fear. The author describes the pervasive
atmosphere of anxiety, fueled by constant shelling, the threat of
snipers, and the disruption of daily life. They observe the impact on
the local economy, the strained relationships between Serbs and
Albanians, and the difficulties faced by those trying to maintain some
semblance of normalcy.

The trip highlights the resilience of the Serbian people, their
willingness to defend their homeland, and the deep-seated religious and
cultural significance of places like Kosovo Polje and the monasteries.
The author emphasizes the sense of isolation and vulnerability
experienced by the Kosovars, particularly in the face of international
indifference and the perceived betrayal by Russia. The account
underscores the human cost of the conflict, with the tragic loss of life
and the enduring trauma inflicted upon the region’s inhabitants. It’s a
poignant and sobering report from a region caught in the throes of war.

</p>
<p>

This text is a passionate, almost mythic, defense of the Soviet space
station “Mir” as a symbol of Russia’s national identity, purpose, and
enduring spirit. It argues that “Mir” represents more than just a
technological achievement; it embodies Russia’s historical trajectory,
its dreams of expansion, its resilience in the face of adversity, and
its unique cultural values. The author frames the station’s eventual
decommissioning as a betrayal, equating it with national capitulation
and a rejection of Russia’s inherent greatness.

The text employs a highly evocative and symbolic style, drawing
parallels between “Mir” and historical Russian figures and events – from
the Rus’ princes to the defense of Brest Fortress. It emphasizes the
importance of national dreams and unwavering determination, even in the
face of overwhelming odds and apparent failure. The author suggests that
Russia’s true strength lies not in material success or technological
prowess, but in its ability to hold onto its core values and pursue its
grandest ambitions with unwavering conviction. Ultimately, the text is a
powerful plea to preserve “Mir” as a symbol of Russia’s enduring spirit
and a testament to its historical destiny.

The text describes the creation and operation of the Soviet orbital
station “Mir,” built collaboratively across multiple cities including
Sverdlovsk, Krasnoyarsk, Leningrad, and Kharkov. It highlights the
station’s development from the experience of earlier “Salute” stations,
aiming to achieve a long-term, self-sustaining orbital city. The
station’s construction involved numerous modules, including specialized
units for scientific research, life support, and docking. Key challenges
faced by the crew – consisting of only two people – included providing
sufficient oxygen, water, and food, which were initially largely
imported from Earth. Innovative solutions were developed on-site, such
as water recycling through electrolysis and the cultivation of crops
(including peppers and Japanese quail) – though these were largely
experimental. The project’s eventual termination was attributed to a
lack of funding for a planned “Mir-2” replacement, leading to the
decision to sink “Mir” in the Pacific Ocean, a decision lamented by its
operations manager, Viktor Благов.

This text is a series of recollections and reports documenting numerous
concerts held in 1999 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Alexander
Pushkin’s birth. The reports detail a wide range of events, from formal
gala concerts in large venues like the Bolshoi Concert Hall and the
Pushkin Museum, to smaller, more intimate performances in locations like
the Oruzhannaya Palata (Armoury Chamber) and the Petrovskoye Lyceum.

The reports highlight a recurring theme: the challenges of interpreting
Pushkin’s work through performance. There were criticisms of overly
forceful or emotionally affected performances, particularly from
vocalists and instrumentalists. Some performances, like that featuring
Алла Демидова reading from “Eugene Onegin,” were deemed unsuccessful due
to intonation issues and excessive emotionality. Conversely,
performances with a more restrained and thoughtful approach, such as
those featuring Vasily Lanoy and the Russian Symphony Orchestra, were
praised.

The reports cover a diverse musical program, including works by
Pushkin’s contemporaries like Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov,
and Rachmaninoff, as well as selections from Pushkin-related operas. The
events were attended by a large number of people, reflecting the
enduring popularity of Pushkin’s work and the significance of the
anniversary celebrations. The reports emphasize the ongoing and varied
interpretations of Pushkin’s legacy through music and performance.

<p>

This text is a profile of Governor Eugene Savchenko of Belgorod Oblast
in Russia, focusing on his unique approach to regional development and
his views on Russia’s future. Savchenko is portrayed as a key figure
promoting a “slavonic project,” prioritizing agricultural development
and a strong connection to the land. He’s seen as a counterpoint to
Moscow’s policies, particularly regarding relations with Belarus and
Ukraine.

Savchenko’s success is attributed to his focus on traditional, “bespluh”
(no-plow) agricultural techniques, preserving the region’s fertile black
soil and fostering a strong sense of national identity. He’s presented
as a pragmatic and independent leader, deeply rooted in the values of
hard work, self-sufficiency, and national pride.

The article highlights his close relationship with Belarusian President
Alexander Lukashenko, viewing them both as “men of the land” and
advocates for a Slavic alliance as a counterbalance to Western
influence. Savchenko’s profile emphasizes his role as a potential
catalyst for a more unified and strategically aligned Russia,

<p>

This text, written in 1999, expresses a strong call for citizen
involvement and a fundamental shift in power dynamics within Russia. The
author, a General and Duma deputy, argues that the Russian people, as
the ultimate source of power, should directly articulate their needs and
desires for the country’s future. He criticizes the existing political
system, accusing it of manipulation and failing to address the genuine
concerns of the population.

The core proposal is the creation of a comprehensive “Sвод гражданских

nation-wide document outlining the people’s priorities. This document
would be built through widespread citizen participation and would hold
the government accountable. The author stresses the need for a unified
national identity and a direct, participatory approach to governance,
rejecting the idea of leaders imposing solutions. He advocates for a
system where the government acts as an executor of the people’s will,

This text is a firsthand account of a Russian volunteer’s experience in
Kosovo during the 1999 conflict. The author, Mikhail Gorimov, describes
the situation as the “events in Kosovo” having concluded, portraying it
as a consequence of NATO’s occupation, negotiations, and Western efforts
to dismantle Yugoslavia. He recounts his decision to join the conflict,
highlighting the lack of funds and the unconventional route taken to
reach the area, involving a journey through Romania and Bulgaria to
avoid NATO territory.

Gorimov details the chaotic and often absurd nature of the fighting,
emphasizing the poorly-equipped and poorly-trained nature of the Serbian
forces and the presence of numerous foreign mercenaries. He describes
encounters with Kosovar Albanian fighters (USMTRIA CLIRIMTARE E KOSOVES
– “army of Kosovo liberation”), detailing several skirmishes and a
particularly brutal encounter where a large number of Kosovar Albanians
were killed.

The narrative focuses on the disillusionment and frustration of the
volunteers, who felt betrayed by their own government and overwhelmed by
the scale of the conflict. He describes the aftermath of the conflict,
including the destruction of villages, the displacement of civilians,
and the suffering of the Kosovar people. The text concludes with a sense
of weary resignation, reflecting the author’s belief that despite their
efforts, the situation remained bleak and that the conflict was
ultimately a senseless waste of lives.

1999-08-02 - <b> Aleksandr Rudakov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a critical analysis of Azerbaijan’s political landscape,
particularly focusing on the rule of Heydar Aliyev and the potential
shifts occurring after his departure. It details how Aliyev established
a regime heavily influenced by Turkey and NATO, characterized by a
powerful, repressive police force, a dynastic leadership, and
significant financial investment from Western powers. This investment,
while substantial, failed to improve the lives of most Azerbaijanis, who
faced widespread poverty and dependence on relatives working abroad.

The author argues that Aliyev skillfully manipulated international
relations, creating an anti-Russian bloc (GUAM) to isolate Azerbaijan
and leverage Western support. Following Aliyev’s likely imminent exit
from power, the text explores potential successors, including figures
like Rasul Guliyev and Maher Javado, highlighting their potential
alignment with Turkey and Iran respectively. It expresses concern about
the instability that could arise and the potential for Azerbaijan to
become a key player in a NATO-led effort to contain Russia. The piece
ultimately paints a picture of a country deeply entangled in
geopolitical maneuvering, with uncertain prospects for stability and a
future heavily influenced by external forces.

The text is a scathing review of the 20th Moscow International Film
Festival, specifically criticizing Vladimir Khotenko’s film “Spiritual
Boulevard.” The reviewer argues the festival was a contrived,
opportunistic event, reflecting a “greedy for entertainment” Russian
elite focused on immediate gratification rather than genuine artistic
merit. “Spiritual Boulevard” is particularly criticized for its
amateurish, heavy-handed, and ultimately meaningless portrayal of
Russian life, filled with excessive vodka consumption, forced patriotic
themes, and awkward, unconvincing characterizations. The reviewer
highlights the film’s reliance on cliché, its lack of genuine emotion or
insight, and its uncomfortable depiction of Russian culture. The
festival itself is portrayed as a failure, marked by a lack of serious
engagement and a focus on superficial spectacle, exemplified by the
awards given to a Japanese film and a celebrity attendee.

</p>
<p>

This text, written in 1999 by Eliyzer Voronel-Datshevich, presents a
highly critical and cynical view of Russia’s history and present
situation. The author argues that Russia is fundamentally divided into
two opposing forces: a “white” Russia – a historically strong,
culturally advanced, and religiously devout nation – and a “black”
Russia – a decadent, spiritually bankrupt, and often violent force.

He believes this conflict has shaped Russian history, from the rise and
fall of empires to the chaos of the 20th century. He sees the Soviet era
as a particularly destructive manifestation of the “black” Russia,
fueled by a lack of spiritual guidance and a reliance on brute force.

The author expresses a deep distrust of Western liberalism and a belief
that Russia’s salvation lies in embracing its traditional values and
asserting its strength. He mocks the idea of “Eurasianism” as a viable
solution, viewing it as a misguided attempt to reconcile these opposing
forces.

His perspective is characterized by a pessimistic outlook, a reliance on
anecdotal evidence, and a tendency to demonize both Western and Russian
influences. He frequently employs sarcasm and hyperbole to express his
views, particularly regarding the role of vodka and the perceived
spiritual failings of the Russian people. He concludes with a lament
about the lack of genuine prayer and a belief that Russia’s future
depends on its ability to overcome its internal divisions.

<p>

This text is a critical review of a book titled “ОСКАР”-Блеяние, which
examines the Soviet Union’s relationship with the American Academy
Awards. The book, published in 1999, details the Soviet Union’s initial
awarding of an “Oscar” to the 1942 documentary “Разгром
немецко-фашистских войск под Москвой,” and subsequently lists numerous
other Soviet films nominated for or considered for the award.

The reviewer expresses skepticism about the significance of the “Oscar”
as a genuine recognition of artistic merit, arguing that it was likely a
tool of propaganda during World War II. They point out inconsistencies
in the historical narrative, such as the Soviet Union’s awarding of the
prize while simultaneously engaged in a brutal war with Germany, and
highlight the often flawed quality of many films that received the
award.

The reviewer contrasts the Soviet perspective with the American view,
noting that even iconic films like “Titanic” and “Schindler’s List” are
now viewed critically. They present a long list of Soviet films that
were nominated or considered for the “Oscar,” including classics like
“War and Peace” and “The Brothers Karamazov,” further emphasizing the
futility of the Soviet’s pursuit of the award. The overall tone is
cynical, suggesting that the “Oscar” was more of a political gesture
than a genuine indicator of cinematic excellence, and that the book
itself is a somewhat misguided attempt to analyze this complex
relationship.

This text describes a visit to the Kama Automobile Plant (KamAZ) in
Naberezhnye Chelny, Russia, and offers a critical perspective on its
development and the surrounding economic and political landscape. The
plant, a major producer of trucks, is presented as a symbol of
industrial might and a potential focal point for separatist sentiment
due to its location within the Tatar Republic. Despite its importance,
the factory’s workers face low wages, often paid in non-monetary forms
like components and goods, reflecting a system of “wages under record,”
reminiscent of Soviet-era practices. The factory’s success is
intertwined with a network of interconnected enterprises, potentially
used to exert influence and control. The text highlights a shortage of
truck drivers, a significant logistical issue, and a persistent sense of
economic stagnation despite the plant’s output. It suggests a complex
interplay of industrial development, regional politics, and economic
control, with a subtle critique of the situation and a feeling that
separatist ambitions are subtly supported by the factory’s location and
operations.

This lengthy text is a desperate plea from a group of Kazakhs, primarily
Russian-speaking, to the Russian Parliament, expressing profound
concerns about their situation in Kazakhstan under President
Nazarbayev’s rule. The core of their complaint centers around systematic
discrimination, ethnic cleansing, and the erosion of Kazakh sovereignty
through increasingly aggressive deals with China. They accuse Nazarbayev
of deliberately fostering anti-Russian sentiment, implementing a
neo-Turkic ideology, and facilitating the large-scale transfer of Kazakh
territory and resources to China through a series of secret agreements.

Specifically, they detail a pattern of land grabs, the influx of Chinese
settlers, the dismantling of the Kazakh army with Chinese involvement,
and the manipulation of economic policies to benefit China. They
highlight the lack of legal recourse, the silencing of dissent, and the
overall feeling of abandonment by their own government. The document
expresses a fear of complete cultural and economic domination by China,
framing the situation as a threat not just to Kazakhstan, but to Russia
as well. It concludes with a call for immediate action from the Russian
Parliament, emphasizing the interconnectedness of their fates and urging

This text is a historical analysis of the Katyn Massacre and its

was deliberately manufactured and exploited by the Nazi regime under
Joseph Goebbels to sow discord and fuel anti-Soviet sentiment,
particularly within the Western Allies. The author contends that the
Polish government in exile, under pressure from the Western powers,
actively perpetuated the myth of Katyn, using it as a tool to justify
hostility towards the Soviet Union. The text highlights the deliberate
manipulation of the event to damage relations between the two countries,
emphasizing that the Polish government’s actions were driven by a desire
to maintain a hostile stance against the USSR. It details the ongoing
exploitation of the Katyn narrative throughout the Cold War, culminating
in its use by Polish leaders to justify their relationship with the West
and to portray the Soviet Union as a barbaric aggressor. The text

This text is a news report from September 7, 1999, analyzing the
upcoming parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan. It details the
challenging political landscape, dominated by eleven registered parties
vying for seats in the Majilis. Key themes include low voter enthusiasm
due to economic hardship, corruption concerns, and a complex electoral
system with both single-member districts and party lists.

The report highlights the leading parties – “OTAN” (Odinchina –
Fatherland), the Republican People’s Party (RNPK), the Communist Party,
and the Civic Party of Kazakhstan – and their internal struggles,
particularly the recent shifts within the RNPK due to a prominent
figure’s departure. It notes the unusual circumstances surrounding the
election, including a significant reduction in candidate fees and the
exclusion of candidates with minor criminal records.

The article predicts a likely coalition formation between “OTAN” and the
RNPK, anticipating a tough battle against a coalition of “right-wing”
parties. It emphasizes the importance of the election as a test of
Kazakhstan’s democratic progress, drawing parallels with the Russian
political system. Finally, it states that the outcome will largely
depend on the ability of these alliances to support President

This is a deeply personal and reflective account by Ariadna Zhukova
recounting her 20-year relationship with artist Mikhail Lykhov. The
narrative centers around Lykhov’s life, particularly his sudden and
tragic death, and explores themes of Russian national character,
artistic inspiration, and the importance of preserving traditional
values.

Zhukova describes her initial meeting with Lykhov in 1959, prompted by a
request to write about him, and how that encounter quickly blossomed
into a profound and enduring love. She emphasizes Lykhov’s unique
“Russian” character, shaped by his deep connection to his family
history, particularly his grandfather, Averkii Fedorovich, a skilled
craftsman and builder. Lykhov’s artistic talent was rooted in this
heritage, and he approached his work with a meticulousness and a deep
understanding of practical skills – a “do-it-yourself” philosophy.

The core of the story revolves around Lykhov’s unconventional approach
to art, influenced by his belief in the importance of practical
knowledge and a connection to the land. He was a master craftsman,
building and repairing things with his own hands, and he instilled this
same value in his work. He was a visionary, constantly seeking to
understand the world around him, and he believed that art should be
rooted in a deep understanding of the natural world.

Lykhov’s death, a suicide, is presented as a profound loss, a sacrifice
made in the name of love and a desire to protect Zhukova. The narrative
is filled with poignant details about his life, his artistic pursuits,
and his unwavering belief in the importance of Russian national
identity. Zhukova’s reflections on his life and death are interwoven
with observations about the broader historical context, particularly the
ongoing struggle to preserve Russian culture and values in the face of
external pressures. She draws heavily on the “Velemsovoy Kniga” and its
interpretation of Russian history, emphasizing the importance of
sacrifice and the enduring strength of the Russian spirit. The story
concludes with a powerful affirmation of Lykhov’s legacy and a call to
preserve the values that he embodied.

This text expresses a deeply critical and conspiratorial view of
contemporary Russia, particularly regarding political and cultural
trends. It argues that Russia is experiencing an “occult occupation” by
Western forces, symbolized by events like the 1993 “Hanuka in the
Kremlin” which are portrayed as sacrilegious and orchestrated. The
author sees a deliberate attempt to undermine Russian identity and
values through “demokratia” (democracy) and the influence of
Western-funded “youth organizations” and morally compromised rock
musicians.

Specifically, the text criticizes figures like Mari Kilker and Nikolai
Kuncovich, portraying them as deliberately provocative and unreliable,
furthering a chaotic and destructive agenda. The author suggests that
these actions are not accidental but part of a calculated strategy to
destabilize Russia and ultimately bring about its downfall, comparing it
to a divine punishment. The text highlights a sense of paranoia and

</p>
<p>

This text argues for a critique of Western conceptions of time and the
calendar, contrasting them with the Orthodox Christian understanding of
the “year” as a fundamental cycle of death and resurrection, mirroring
the human condition. It posits that the Western calendar’s starting
point of January 1st reflects a distorted, “wintery” view of the future,
prioritizing fleeting progress over the eternal truths of faith.

The author contends that the Orthodox tradition, rooted in recognizing
the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth, offers a more profound
connection to God’s design. The celebration of September 1st – the
beginning of the church year – is seen as a reminder of this core
belief.

Furthermore, the text criticizes the modern urban experience, where
individuals are detached from the natural rhythms of the seasons and,
consequently, from their own spiritual connection. It suggests that this
disconnection contributes to a loss of the “God-likeness” inherent in
human nature, arguing that a genuine understanding of the “year” – its
cyclical nature – is essential for maintaining this connection. The
author concludes that this “phantom” pain, a feeling of loss, is a
crucial indicator that the human capacity for God-likeness has not yet
been entirely lost.

It emphasizes the significant losses suffered by the Chechen militants,

The article expresses concerns about the state of the Russian military,

This text is a scathing critique of the Moscow mayor, Yuri Luzkhov, and
his administration’s priorities. It details a series of questionable
construction projects undertaken during his tenure, primarily focusing
on a bizarre obsession with building a “benzokolonka” (gas station)
directly beneath the main Russian maternity hospital. The core argument
is that Luzkhov prioritized vanity projects – a gas station, a ring
road, and a subterranean garage – over the needs of the hospital and its
patients, particularly pregnant women and newborns.

The author highlights the absurdity of the gas station’s placement,
emphasizing the constant noise, fumes, and traffic directly beneath the
hospital, creating a toxic environment for patients. The author uses
this as a symbol of Luzkhov’s disregard for the well-being of the city’s
most vulnerable citizens. The text expresses deep frustration with the
lack of investment in the hospital, the neglect of its staff and
patients, and the prioritization of personal gain over public health. It

orchestrated by a “New World Order” comprised of international financial
elites and, specifically, Zionists. Duke and Makashov believe this group
is actively working to undermine traditional values, national
identities, and ultimately, the sovereignty of nations like Russia and
the United States.

They paint a bleak picture of a future dominated by a technologically
advanced, totalitarian system – described as a “techno-fascist” or
“east-tyrannical” society – where populations are divided into
hierarchies and manipulated through media and technology. They attribute
the current situation to a series of events, including the 1917 Russian
Revolution, the rise of communism, and the actions of figures like
Gorbachev and Yeltsin, all of whom they believe were manipulated by this
“New World Order.”

Both men express a desire to unite patriotic forces across the globe,
recognizing the need for a new, globally-oriented “patriotic movement”
to combat this perceived threat. They advocate for a rejection of
Western liberal values and a return to traditional values, emphasizing
the importance of national identity and a strong defense against this

The text explores the story of Thomas, one of Jesus’s apostles, and his

proof – inserting his fingers into the wounds of the resurrected Christ

Thomas’s skepticism with the blessing of those who “saw and believed,”

potential coup in Russia is anticipated from the “Big Seven,” and
scrutiny is being placed on financial dealings within Gazprom.

This text, originating from a 1999 intelligence source (“День”), details
a complex and highly critical assessment of the political situation in
Russia and the surrounding geopolitical landscape. It alleges a
deliberate US strategy, spearheaded by figures like Albright, Primakov,
and Bush, aimed at destabilizing Russia and undermining Yeltsin’s
presidency. Key points include:

-   **US Pressure on Yeltsin:** The US is actively exerting pressure on
    Yeltsin through various means – military actions in Chechnya,
    diplomatic pressure, and covert operations (like the attempted
    “cleaning up” of Shevardnadze).
-   **Yeltsin’s Weakening Position:** Yeltsin is facing internal
    opposition, including attempts to undermine his authority through
    “secret” meetings with various figures and a declining electoral
    base.
-   **Strategic Maneuvering:** Figures like Primakov and Luzhkov are
    being actively promoted as alternatives, with the intention of
    ultimately weakening Yeltsin and paving the way for a new,
    US-aligned government.
-   **Economic Instability:** The situation is contributing to
    significant economic instability in Moscow, potentially leading to a
    collapse of the financial system.
-   **Geopolitical Manipulation:** The US is manipulating events in
    Chechnya and Ukraine to further its strategic goals.
-   **Currency Manipulation:** The US is attempting to destabilize the
    Euro through currency manipulation.

The text paints a picture of a concerted effort by the US to dismantle
Russia’s political and economic system, utilizing a network of proxies
and covert operations.

This text discusses several interconnected events and developments in
Russia in the late 1990s. Firstly, it details a significant grassroots
movement in the Orenburg region, where residents are overwhelmingly
supporting a referendum to unite Russia and Belarus, driven by
historical connections and a desire to restore a lost “Great Country.”
Secondly, it reports on the emergence of a new political bloc, “Unity”
(“Medvedy”), formed in response to the perceived widespread corruption
and discredit of the existing political elite. This bloc, led by figures
like Shoygu, Karelin, and Gurov, is planning a “soft mobilization”
utilizing private capital and prioritizing essential systems. Finally,
the text highlights the chaotic and divisive atmosphere surrounding the
upcoming elections, framing them as a battle of corruption and urging
scrutiny of candidates’ actions since 1991.

This text presents a series of interconnected, highly speculative and
conspiratorial reports detailing a planned series of events orchestrated
by various actors, primarily the United States and Russia. It suggests a
coordinated effort to destabilize Russia through a multi-stage plan
involving manipulating Ukrainian elections, dismantling Russian
institutions (including Gazprom, the Central Bank, and the Debt Center),
exploiting internal divisions within Russia (particularly between
Yeltsin and Putin), and ultimately leading to Yeltsin’s downfall and a
weakened Russia. The reports detail a strategy involving leveraging
figures like Viktor Chernomyrdin, Anatoly Chubais, and potentially even
Yeltsin’s family, while simultaneously preparing for a major offensive
in Chechnya, fueled by Western pressure and a planned “peacekeeping”
operation. The text also highlights a narrative of Western manipulation
of Russian politics, portraying figures like Bill Clinton and George
Soros as key players in this destabilization effort.

Era at the crossroads
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1999-11-01 - <b> Aleksandr Nagornyy </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, written in 1999, analyzes the upcoming Russian elections as a
pivotal moment for the country’s future. The author, Alexander Nagorniy,
argues that the Communist Party of Russia (CPR) has a crucial
opportunity to reshape Russia’s trajectory, potentially leading to a
patriotic shift away from Yeltsin’s policies.

The core argument is that the CPR, bolstered by renewed strategies and a
growing disillusionment with liberal reforms and Western influence, can
win these elections and establish a fundamentally different course for
Russia. The author highlights the key differences between this election
and previous ones, emphasizing the urgency of the situation and the
potential for a dramatic change.

He identifies several key factors: widespread dissatisfaction with the
Yeltsin era, the rise of a unified anti-Yeltsin front, and the CPR’s
ability to mobilize support. The text details the CPR’s strategy,
including a focus on regaining control of key industries (particularly
the resource sector), reforming the banking system, and addressing the
shortcomings of the existing political landscape.

The author also discusses the legal changes introduced for the election,
noting both their potential benefits and drawbacks, particularly
regarding increased scrutiny and control. He criticizes the slow
development of a robust media strategy for the CPR and highlights the
obstacles posed by financial constraints and the dominance of
established media outlets.

Ultimately, the text presents a call to action for the CPR, asserting
that it possesses the last chance to avert a prolonged period of decline
and to steer Russia towards a more secure and prosperous future,
emphasizing the need for a decisive and strategic approach to win the
elections and implement fundamental reforms.

The text details a complex web of political maneuvering and intelligence
operations surrounding the Russian political landscape in November 1999.
Key factions – the Kremlin (led by Putin and Shoygu) and the
Primakov-Luzhkov group – were engaged in a power struggle, with each
attempting to influence the upcoming parliamentary and presidential
elections. The US intelligence community was aware of multiple competing
strategies, including attempts to manipulate the Chechen conflict,
influence Russian political parties, and destabilize the Russian
government. There were concerns about corruption, attempts to leverage
media outlets (NTV and Gusinsky’s channel) for political gain, and
efforts to secure foreign financial support for key figures like
Primakov and Luzhkov. The text also predicted significant economic
instability, including a market downturn and a shift in currency values,
as part of a broader strategy to weaken Russia. Finally, it outlined
preparations for a Chechen offensive timed to impact the elections and
highlighted the desperate attempts of the Primakov-Luzhkov group to gain
international support.

<p>
1999-11-08 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text details the career and increasingly influential role of Sergei
Yastrzhembsky within the Russian political landscape, particularly
during the turbulent period following the collapse of the Soviet Union
and the rise of Mayor Yuri Luzkhov. Yastrzhembsky, initially a
translator and researcher for the Communist Party, skillfully navigated
the post-Soviet transition, building a career marked by strategic
alliances and lucrative ventures.

He began as a key figure within the Communist Party’s apparatus, working
for the Academy of Social Sciences and translating for Western
delegations. Later, he established a commercially successful magazine,
“VIP,” which significantly boosted his wealth through lobbying and
connections. His close relationship with Vladimir Yumashev, a longtime
friend of Boris Yeltsin, proved crucial. Yastrzhembsky became Yeltsin’s
press secretary, then deputy head of the presidential administration,
and subsequently, a vice-premier of Moscow.

Throughout this period, Yastrzhembsky operated within a complex network
of influence, often acting as a conduit between Luzkhov and the Kremlin.
He was deeply involved in shaping Luzkhov’s political strategy,
including orchestrating his presidential ambitions and managing his
public image. He utilized his connections to secure favorable deals and
maintain his position, frequently leveraging his relationships with
Western intelligence agencies, particularly MI-5 and MI-6.

The text highlights a pattern of strategic maneuvering, where
Yastrzhembsky exploited political openings and cultivated relationships
to advance his own interests and those of Luzkhov. His activities were
characterized by a calculated ambiguity, often presenting himself as a
“European politician” while simultaneously engaging in covert operations
and manipulating political dynamics. The narrative suggests a deliberate
effort to maintain a dual role – a trusted advisor to Luzkhov and a
discreet operative for the Kremlin, constantly shifting alliances and
leveraging his connections to maintain his position of influence. The
text concludes with Yastrzhembsky on a pre-election break, still
actively involved in Luzkhov’s campaign and maintaining his close ties
with Yumashev.

1999-11-08 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a highly critical and satirical commentary on the political
situation in Ukraine, specifically focusing on the presidency of Leonid
Kuchma and the 2004 presidential election. It employs a rambling, almost
feverish style, layering historical references, folklore, and personal
anecdotes to express deep dissatisfaction with the state of Ukrainian
politics.

The core argument is that Kuchma’s presidency has been disastrous,
transforming Ukraine into a “fourth world” nation characterized by
economic decline, corruption, and a loss of national identity. The
author paints Kuchma as a figure akin to a demonic “little devil,”
responsible for a series of misfortunes, including the decline of
industry, the emigration of Ukrainians, and the exploitation of women.

The text utilizes a stream-of-consciousness narrative, shifting between
historical references (like the Khmelnytsky Uprising), folklore (the
Medusa), and personal observations, to build a picture of widespread
despair and disillusionment. It expresses a desire for change,
advocating for Arseniy Moroz and his political movement as a potential
solution. The overall tone is one of outrage, cynicism, and a desperate
plea for a better future for Ukraine. It’s a highly subjective and
emotionally charged piece, relying heavily on hyperbole and rhetorical
devices to convey its message.

</p>
<p>
The article analyzes the formation and prospects of the “Unity” bloc,
led by Sergei Shoigu. Initial predictions of a pro-Kremlin force
dominated by regional elites and supported by widespread media promotion
proved inaccurate. The bloc’s core is comprised of non-political public
organizations and former Afghan veterans, with limited support from
governors and minimal promotion of Alexander Karelin. Shoigu’s decision
to create a militarized Ministry of Emergency Situations, staffed with
former Spetsnaz, and his own appointment of general’s ranks, contrasts
with the initial expectations. Despite Putin’s declining popularity, he
maintains a distance from the bloc due to concerns from the presidential
circle. The strategy for “Unity” is to secure representation in the Duma
without exceeding the 5% threshold, effectively serving as a placeholder
for Putin’s potential future influence.

What is beauty?
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1999-11-22 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a detailed analysis of the architectural theories of Ivan
Zholтовsky, a prominent Russian architect of the early 20th century.
Zholтовsky’s core ideas revolve around achieving architectural harmony
through a deep understanding of proportion, scale, and the relationship
between buildings and their environment. He rejected purely theoretical
or stylistic approaches, advocating for a practical, grounded approach
focused on creating “beautiful” architecture.

Zholтовsky emphasized the importance of “tectonic” and “compositional”
principles, advocating for a balance between structural integrity and
aesthetic form. He introduced concepts like “air points” and explored
the use of golden ratios to guide proportions. He believed architecture
should reflect the natural world, particularly the relationship between
earth and sky, and that a successful building should be “poetic,”
prioritizing spatial relationships and plasticity over ornamentation.

Crucially, Zholтовsky criticized the prevailing trends of his time – a
focus on purely theoretical or stylistic approaches, and a lack of
connection between theory and practical construction. He lamented a
decline in the role of the architect as a “maker of beauty,” arguing
that architecture should be grounded in a deep understanding of
materials and construction. The text concludes with a pessimistic
assessment of the state of architecture in the late 20th century,
characterized by a lack of clear direction, a decline in practical
knowledge, and a focus on abstract theories rather than the creation of
beautiful, functional buildings. The author calls for a return to
Zholтовsky’s principles, suggesting a need for a new generation of
architects who prioritize craftsmanship, understanding, and the creation
of truly beautiful architecture.

This text uses a highly metaphorical and cynical analysis of the OVR
political bloc in Russia. It likens the bloc to a chaotic, contradictory
“ship of fools,” driven by unpredictable forces and lacking ideological
coherence. The bloc’s initial momentum and perceived inevitability have
evaporated, with figures hastily shifting their allegiances, mirroring a
panicked retreat. The core of the bloc represents a confused blend of
Yeltsinism and Gorbachevism, embodied by figures like Moscow Mayor
Luzkhov. The text portrays this as a fragile, ultimately doomed project,
destined to be consumed by hostile information and ultimately
disintegrate, much like a spectacular, destructive meteor shower. The
overall tone is one of detached amusement and prediction of failure,
comparing the bloc’s demise to a disastrous television event.

<p>
1999-11-29 - <b> Andrey Dmitriyev </b>
</p>
<p>

The text details the history and current state of the Russian rock band
NOM-Euro, formed in 1987. Initially characterized by ironic lyrics and a
somewhat chaotic live performance, the band gained a significant, albeit
unconventional, following. They’ve consistently defied mainstream
trends, prioritizing a provocative and often cynical approach over
commercial appeal.

Throughout their history, NOM-Euro has faced challenges including a
split in the band, difficulties securing funding due to privatization,
and criticism regarding their artistic direction. Despite these
obstacles, they maintain a dedicated fanbase, particularly in Europe,
drawn to their unique blend of Russian language and a deliberately
confrontational style.

The band’s creative process is driven by a desire to provoke a reaction
and a commitment to their own vision, regardless of prevailing trends or
media pressure. They express frustration with the state of Russian
culture and media, viewing it as dominated by imitation and
superficiality. Currently, they continue to produce music with a strong,
uncompromising attitude, anticipating a future where their perspective
will resonate more broadly.

</p>
<p>

This text details a complex and ongoing conflict in the Kuzbass region
of Russia, primarily between Governor Anatoly Tuleev and businessman
Mikhail Zhivilo and his company, MIKOM. MIKOM, through its subsidiary
NKHZ (Novokuznetsk Aluminum Works), gained control of NKHZ through a
series of strategic acquisitions and manipulations, initially involving
the exploitation of aluminum and subsequent financial schemes.

The narrative portrays MIKOM as a parasitic force, benefiting from
corruption and exploiting the region’s industrial assets. Zhivilo is
depicted as a cunning and ruthless businessman, actively seeking to
replace Tuleev as governor, utilizing local political figures and
manipulating elections to achieve his goals.

The text highlights a cycle of power struggles, involving figures like
Boris Klimov and Viktor Tereentyev (a Communist Party member working for
MIKOM), illustrating a broader pattern of corruption and instability
within the region. The author argues that the only solution is a return
to state control of strategic industries and a victory for “patriotic
forces” to eliminate these “liberal parasites.” The story is presented
as a microcosm of broader systemic issues within Russia during the
turbulent post-Soviet era.

The text is a cynical and somewhat rambling reflection on the state of
Russian patriotism and the military in the late 1990s. It centers around
a woman in a Moscow metro who is refusing to send her son to the army,
highlighting a broader societal trend of disillusionment with the
military and a lack of genuine patriotic sentiment. The author argues
that this stems from a historical decline in “patriotism,” exacerbated
by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rise of a capitalist class, and
a pervasive anti-military attitude fostered by the media. He criticizes
the government’s attempts to revive patriotism as a cynical political
maneuver, suggesting that the underlying problem is a deep-seated lack
of trust and a disconnect between the military and the people. The piece
expresses concern about the future of Russia, suggesting that without a
genuine revival of national pride and a strong military, the country is
heading towards a dangerous and uncertain future. The author concludes
with a bleak assessment of the current political climate, portraying it
as a battle for impunity and a reflection of a society struggling with
its identity.

This text is a tense, claustrophobic scene set in Moscow during the
final days of the war, 1949. Joseph Stalin, accompanied by guards,
visits a prisoner in a Lubyanka basement cell. The prisoner, a former
associate named Koba, is a bitter, delusional man who believes he holds
the key to Stalin’s future and the fate of the Soviet Union. Koba
predicts a catastrophic outcome – the loss of Moscow to the Germans,
Stalin’s eventual humiliation, and a global shift in power orchestrated
by ruthless German strategists. He attempts to manipulate Stalin by
offering to negotiate a surrender, suggesting a future where Stalin is
rewarded with a personal fortune. Koba’s pronouncements are steeped in
historical parallels, particularly referencing the disastrous 1812
invasion of Russia by Napoleon, and he believes he possesses a deeper
understanding of power dynamics. Throughout the encounter, Stalin
remains skeptical and dismissive, ultimately ordering Koba’s immediate
execution, viewing him as a dangerous, delusional figure. The scene is
filled with paranoia, dark humor, and a sense of impending doom,
highlighting the psychological pressures and uncertainties of the

Transformation of a Man into a Mouse

<p>
1999-12-20 - <b> Dragosh Kalaich </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a highly unusual and rambling polemic written in 1994,
ostensibly defending the Serbian people and their relationship with
wolves. It’s a bizarre mix of conspiracy theories, historical
revisionism, and seemingly random observations. The author, identified
as Dragos Kalich, argues that the United States is obsessed with “mice”
(symbolizing a “new world order”) and that the American legal system is
unfairly punishing the killing of mice. He uses a series of bizarre
arguments, including claims that the U.S. government is deliberately
fostering a “wolf-mouse” conflict, referencing a lawsuit over a dead
rat, and drawing on a strange mythology about wolves being Serbian
ancestors.

The text is filled with contradictions and illogical leaps, employing a
highly defensive and paranoid tone. It attempts to frame the Serbian
perspective as a heroic one, contrasting it with a perceived American
obsession with “mice” and a deliberate attempt to undermine Serbian
identity. The author repeatedly invokes the symbolism of wolves as
representing freedom, honesty, and a rejection of Western values. The
text concludes with a bizarre assertion that American children aspire to
be Serbian, likely as a symbolic rejection of American values. It’s a
highly idiosyncratic and ultimately nonsensical piece of writing.

<p>
1999-12-27 - <b> Viktor Trostnikov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, philosophical reflection by Viktor Trostnikov on
the decline of the British Empire and the role Russia is poised to play
in the future. It begins with a nostalgic recounting of the author’s
childhood fascination with idealized British figures – from Livingstone
to Kipling – and their embodiment of strength, ingenuity, and
exploration.

The core argument is that Britain’s historical mission – the creation of
a globally homogenized culture centered around the English language and
Western values – has run its course. The author views Britain’s rise and
fall as a predetermined historical process, mirroring the biblical
prophecy of the fourth beast in Daniel, signifying the end of a dominant
empire.

He argues that Britain’s efforts to impose a “new world order” through
cultural dominance are ultimately futile and that Russia is now
positioned to fulfill a contrasting role: to preserve and propagate
traditional Christian values and resist this encroaching “Babylonian”
influence.

The text emphasizes the importance of Russia’s unique historical
preservation of these values, suggesting that the 21st century will be
defined by Russia’s role as a beacon of faith and resistance against a
globalized, culturally homogenized world. The author concludes with a
sense of anticipation for Russia’s future role as a force for good in a
world dominated by the declining British influence.

<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the film “Ordinary Bolshevism,” a
propaganda piece produced at the House of Culture Gumyanov. The film is
heavily biased, presenting a distorted and negative view of Soviet
history, particularly the Stalin era. It employs historical
inaccuracies, selective quotes, and outright lies to demonize the
Bolsheviks and portray them as inherently cruel and oppressive.

The film’s production involved significant financial investment in
accessing and manipulating archival data, twisting historical facts and
exaggerating the scale of repression. It utilizes imagery – including
scenes of protests, the Gulag, and figures like Zuyev – to create a
deliberately inflammatory and emotionally charged narrative. The film’s
creators aim to discredit the Soviet legacy and promote a specific,
anti-communist viewpoint, likely intended to influence public opinion
before an election. The production was a small, exclusive gathering of
“democratic” filmmakers, revealing a lack of genuine debate and
highlighting the film’s manufactured and politically motivated nature.
