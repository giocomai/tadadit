This text is a remembrance of Georgiy Kunicin, a prominent and complex
figure at the Moscow Literary Institute. Kunicin’s life was marked by a
fascinating blend of experiences – from his early days as a railway
worker and soldier in World War II, to his academic career, including
multiple degrees and a controversial dissertation that was ultimately
rejected despite widespread praise. He was a respected, though sometimes
frustrating, lecturer known for his challenging views on
Marxism-Leninism and his unique approach to philosophical inquiry, often
expressed through titles like “Man, History, and the Universe.”
Kunicin’s life was characterized by a significant and sometimes tragic
arc, including multiple injuries and a disability, alongside his
extensive contributions to literature and philosophy. He was a respected
figure within the Communist Party, though his intellectual independence
and critical perspectives occasionally put him at odds with the party
establishment. The text emphasizes Kunicin’s enduring legacy,
highlighting his numerous publications and the profound impact he had on
generations of students at the Literary Institute, describing him as a
“lion” in appearance and intellect. The author, Sergei Yesin, portrays
Kunicin as a deeply thoughtful and often contradictory individual, a man
whose life and work remain remarkably relevant even today.

Heroes and villains
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-10-14 - <b> Aleksandr Boroday </b>
</p>
<p>

The article, “Heroes and Cowards (Who is Suffering from the Chechen
Syndrome?)” by Alexander Borodai, critiques the widespread negative
portrayal and stigmatization of Russian veterans of the Chechen war.
Borodai argues that the public perception of these veterans as suffering
from a “Chechen syndrome” – characterized by mental instability and
social dysfunction – is largely a manufactured narrative.

He contends that this narrative was actively promoted by media and
political figures following the war, attributing it to a deliberate
attempt to discredit the veterans and undermine their potential
political influence. Borodai points out that the veterans’ struggles are
often linked to broader societal issues – a period of economic and
political instability, coupled with a lack of support upon their return
– rather than inherent psychological damage.

He draws parallels with the experiences of veterans from other
conflicts, including the First and Civil Wars in Russia, and the Vietnam
War in the United States, arguing that veterans’ mental health is more
influenced by societal factors than by the trauma of combat itself. He
emphasizes that veterans, regardless of the outcome of their wars,
represent a vital source of stability and strength for a nation,
particularly during times of crisis. The author concludes that the
“Chechen syndrome” is a deliberate attempt to marginalize and silence a
potentially powerful segment of Russian society.

This text is a travelogue and reflective essay by Mikhail Basmanov
detailing his 1983 trip to China, primarily focusing on visits to
historical and literary sites. He explores the legacy of several
prominent Chinese poets from the Song Dynasty, including I. An (Li
Qingzhao), Su Dunpo, and Yue Fei. Basmanov expresses admiration for
their dedication to ideals of peace, love, and resistance against
corruption and oppression, contrasting this with the perceived
manipulations of powerful figures like Qin Gui.

He emphasizes the resilience and continuity of Chinese culture despite
historical upheavs, noting the natural flow of life and the enduring
power of traditional values. Through his visits to places associated
with these figures – Hangzhou, parks, and memorials – Basmanov reflects
on the importance of upholding moral principles and the cyclical nature
of history, culminating in a personal meditation on the human condition
and the pursuit of ideals. The text is punctuated by several original
poems written during his journey, serving as expressions of his
observations and emotions.

The light of a cruel star
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-10-14 - <b> Vladislav Shurygin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a collection of fragmented letters and recollections
surrounding the death of Captain Petrov during the Chechen conflict.
It’s a deeply melancholic and somewhat surreal portrayal of a soldier’s
experience, marked by disillusionment, loss, and a sense of isolation.

The core narrative revolves around Captain Petrov, a respected and
beloved officer who, despite his role in a brutal war, possessed a
surprisingly gentle and thoughtful nature. His letters reveal a man
grappling with the absurdity of war, his faith, and his relationships,
particularly his connection with a woman who was his wife.

The text is characterized by a cyclical repetition of themes: the
horrors of war, the futility of violence, the difficulty of finding
meaning in a chaotic world, and the enduring power of human connection.
The fragmented nature of the letters – snippets of conversations,
memories, and reflections – creates a disjointed and dreamlike
atmosphere.

The narrator, a fellow soldier named Ryzhik, provides a voice of
observation and lament, often expressing a profound sadness and a sense
of helplessness. He recounts the events surrounding Petrov’s death, the
chaotic conditions of the war zone, and the soldiers’ attempts to cope
with the trauma.

Ultimately, the text is a poignant meditation on the human cost of
conflict and the enduring search for meaning in a world defined by
violence and loss. It’s a story about a man’s brief, impactful life cut
short, and the lingering impact of his death on those who knew him. The
recurring imagery of drinking, the “star” that haunts the narrator, and
the repeated references to the “captain” all contribute to a sense of
unease and a feeling that the story is trapped in a loop of grief and
remembrance.

Dudayev supporters strengthening their power gained from Lebed.
Maschadov is reorganizing the Chechen army, consolidating units into

roads, bridges, and mountain passes are being mined, and fortifications
are being built. Maschadov plans to defeat Russia, and is negotiating
the potential handover of 101st and 205th internal troops brigades, with
the condition that they be staffed by Chechens. He is also developing
plans to support Lebed and discredit Kulikov, potentially through a

Post-election debts
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-10-21 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, dated October 22, 1996, analyzes the disastrous October 1996
visit by U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry to Russia. The visit was
primarily a “pre-election” effort by President Clinton to secure Russian
cooperation regarding the Strategic Nuclear Weapons Treaty (START-2) and
the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) – commonly known as “Star Wars.”
Perry’s visit failed to achieve its goals, primarily because the U.S.
demanded immediate ratification of START-2 while simultaneously pursuing
the deployment of U.S. missile defense systems, specifically the “Thaad”
system, which Russia viewed as a direct threat to its nuclear deterrent.

The visit exposed a fundamental disconnect between the U.S. and Russia,
with Russia perceiving the U.S. actions as a deliberate attempt to
undermine its strategic position. The U.S. secured a concession from
Russia regarding the classification of “Thaad” missiles as tactical,
effectively allowing their deployment near Russian strategic missile
sites. However, this agreement ultimately proved detrimental to Russia’s
security, as the “Thaad” system could be used as a strategic missile
defense system.

The author argues that this visit highlighted a lack of genuine
strategic understanding within the Russian leadership and foreshadowed a
more difficult and potentially destabilizing relationship with the
United States under President Clinton, who was perceived as prioritizing
short-term political gains over Russia’s long-term security interests.
The text concludes with a warning about the potential for further
strategic missteps and the need for Russia to maintain a firm stance in
the face of increasing U.S. pressure.

<p>
Russian civilization is riddled with the emptiness of Yeltsinism,
characterized by decay, pessimism, and a loss of harmony, particularly
in rural and traditional communities. Freedom without a national ideal
has transformed villages into reservations, with intellectuals
exploiting rural life through lavish estates and indulgence. Traditional
forms of rural engagement, such as populist movements and modern
farming, are seen as relics of the past. The village itself is
attempting to rediscover its identity, with the help of a prominent
Russian intellectual, Yuri Ivanov, who is guiding the development of a
new rural community based on the teachings of Porfiry Ivanov.

Ivan Tsarevich’s School

1996-10-21 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, a report from a rural school’s parent-teacher meeting in
1996, details a pedagogical approach centered on the holistic well-being
of children. The teacher, Antonina Ivanova, advocates for addressing
children’s health and development not as a medical issue, but as a
result of psychological and emotional factors within the family
environment.

The core of her method involves creating a positive, supportive
atmosphere free from negative thoughts and anxieties, recognizing that
children are highly sensitive to their parents’ emotional states. She
utilizes techniques like outdoor activities (e.g., cold water
immersion), postural correction, and encouraging open communication to
foster a healthier emotional landscape.

The report highlights a shift in understanding – that children are
reflections of their parents’ relationships and mental states. It
emphasizes the importance of parental self-awareness and emotional
health as a foundation for raising healthy children. The meeting
successfully encourages parents to re-evaluate their perspectives on
child-rearing, focusing on creating a positive and supportive
environment rather than imposing rigid rules or anxieties. The success
of the approach is demonstrated through observed improvements in
children’s health, posture, and academic performance. The meeting
concludes with a sense of shared understanding and a commitment to
fostering a more positive and supportive family environment.

</p>
<p>
Following a rapid shift within the Russian military, including the
replacement of Chief of the General Staff General of the Army Kolesnikov
with General-Colonel Samsonov and the dismissal of personnel due to
alleged ethical violations, the changes are linked to the new Minister
of Defence, Igor Rodionov. These events are being interpreted as either
the beginning of a military reform or behind-the-scenes Kremlin
maneuvering. The Airmobile Troops (VDV), previously shielded by Minister
Pavel Grachev, faced increasing resentment from the Ground Forces. The
departure of the former Chief of the General Staff Kolesnikov and the
involvement of Security Council Secretary Lebedev further fueled
tensions. A directive was issued to reduce the VDV from 60,000 to 40,000
and dissolve some units, with General-Major Kazantsev being removed as a
consequence. The situation highlights a conflict between the VDV’s
privileged status and the desire of the Kremlin and military leadership
to control all armed groups, ultimately causing a significant disruption
to Russian military security.

Presumption of guil
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-10-21 - <b> Sergey Semanov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text explores the concept of “presumption of innocence” within the
context of European legal traditions, particularly comparing it to
Russian legal and societal values. It begins by establishing the Roman
legal foundation shared across Europe and contrasts this with the
Orthodox Christian perspective, where spiritual “grace” takes precedence
over legal “law.” The author critiques the Nюрнберг trial as a flawed
application of the presumption of innocence, arguing that it was
politically motivated and violated established legal principles.

The text then advocates for a proactive approach to societal
instability, suggesting immediate measures against specific categories
of individuals – former Communist officials, wealthy property owners,
those building extravagant residences after 1991, brothel keepers, and
propagandists – to “heal” society. It argues for the importance of
preparing for “unforeseen circumstances” and utilizes the Nюрнберг
trial’s “precedent” as a justification for these drastic actions,
despite acknowledging the legal and moral concerns surrounding them. The
core argument is a call for decisive action to address perceived
societal threats, prioritizing a swift and forceful response over
adherence to established legal norms.

<p>
1996-10-21 - <b> Aleksandr Prokhanov </b>
</p>
<p>

The text is a personal reflection by Alexander Prokhanov following a
trip to China in October 1996, focusing on the stark contrast between
China’s trajectory and Russia’s perceived decline. Prokhanov argues that
Russia missed a crucial opportunity to develop, failing to harness its
rational, centrally-planned potential after the collapse of the Soviet
Union. He attributes this failure to a series of missteps, including the
embrace of a destructive “liberal fascism” and the inability of Russia’s
elite to effectively manage the transition.

The core of the text is a lament for lost potential, viewing China’s
successful shift towards a mixed economy – combining state control with
private enterprise – as a model tragically missed by Russia. Prokhanov
expresses deep concern about the current state of Russia, characterizing
it as a “hole” filled with the remnants of a failed system and dominated
by an irresponsible and destructive elite. He emphasizes the importance
of a strong, centrally-planned state in guiding development and
expresses skepticism about the prospects for a successful return to a
socialist model in Russia. The text concludes with a sense of sorrow and
a recognition of China’s confident progress while Russia struggles with
its legacy.

the importance of understanding one’s roots, accepting the consequences
of choices, and aligning oneself with the natural order. It suggests
that physical and mental ailments often stem from a disconnect from this
natural alignment, and that seeking solutions requires a deep
understanding of one’s own nature and the Teacher’s wisdom. The text
advocates for careful consideration of one’s actions, particularly
regarding family and personal choices, and highlights the role of
observation and introspection in achieving well-being. It stresses the

Russia and its artistic expression. He discusses his artistic
influences, including Karl Bryullov and his time studying in Paris and

This transcript is a recorded conversation between a journalist and the
spiritual leader of Hezbollah, Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, conducted in
Beirut. Fadlallah expresses a critical view of the “peace process” in
the Middle East, arguing it’s driven by Western interests and ignores
the will of the Palestinian people. He believes true peace requires the
return of Palestinians to their homes and rejects the Israeli model of
peace as detrimental to Palestinian interests.

He views Syria and Iran as supporting the southern Lebanese resistance
against Israeli occupation, though he emphasizes that the struggle is
fundamentally a Lebanese one. He dismisses the possibility of a future
reconciliation with Israel, citing the historical injustice of Israel’s
creation and the ongoing occupation. He believes Hezbollah’s actions,
including martyrdom operations, are a necessary form of resistance
stemming from the conditions that fuel it.

Fadlallah paints a pessimistic picture of the future of the Middle East,
arguing that the “peace process” is imposed by Western powers and
ignores the voices of the people. He anticipates a future dominated by a
shifting geopolitical landscape involving Russia, Europe, Japan, and
China, with a potentially more intense economic struggle than a purely
political one. He advises caution for Russia in its dealings with the
United States, advocating for a focus on Eastern markets and
partnerships.

1996-10-28 - <b> M. Dmitriyev </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, dated October 29, 1996, analyzes Japan’s shifting
geopolitical landscape following the end of the Cold War. The Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), led by R. Hashimoto, is aggressively pursuing a
new role as a major regional and global player. Key developments include
Japan’s acceptance into the UN Security Council, a renewed military
buildup including rearmament and a focus on exporting and financial
investments, and a strategic ambition to challenge the United States and
China in the Asia-Pacific region.

The LDP’s rise is fueled by a desire for “revenge” and nationalistic
sentiment, supported by close ties between the party and powerful
Japanese corporations (dzaibatsu). This ambition is particularly focused
on exploiting Russia’s weakened position, specifically targeting the
Russian Far East.

The text highlights a growing rivalry between Japan and Russia, driven
by Japan’s expansionist goals and Russia’s vulnerability. It emphasizes
the importance of Russia’s response, warning that a failure to counter
Japan’s influence could lead to significant losses for Russia in the
region. The author stresses the need for Russia to develop a strong
counter-strategy, particularly in relation to the disputed Kuril
Islands, before a planned visit by Russian Foreign Minister Y. Primakov
to Tokyo in November 1996.

1996-11-04 - <b> Sluzhba bezopasnosti Denʹ </b>
</p>
<p>

The text outlines a planned anti-constitutional coup orchestrated by a
group led by Yegor Chernomyrdin and, primarily, spearheaded by figures
associated with Yegor Gaidar, including Vladimir Potanin, Arkady
Voitinsky, and Boris Berezovsky, with strong backing from figures like
Mikhail Zadornov and leveraging the influence of figures like Anatoly
Chubais. The core of the plan involves destabilizing the Russian
government through a manipulated budget, potentially leading to the
dismissal of Chernomyrdin and the appointment of individuals like Gaidar
or Chubais as interim prime ministers.

The plan relies on divisions within the Duma, particularly between the
Communist Party (led by Gennady Zyuganov) and the government, and seeks
to exploit discontent among governors, regional leaders, and even within
the military and law enforcement. A key tactic involves creating a
parallel executive body under the Security Council, and a coordinated
media campaign to discredit the government and sow confusion.

The text details a two-phase operation: a constitutional phase involving
budget manipulation and potential Duma dissolution, followed by a
non-constitutional phase utilizing propaganda, manipulating regional
elections, and potentially mobilizing protests. The Communist Party is
seen as a crucial element in this strategy, and the text suggests a

Ultimately, the coup aims to consolidate power within the group, and the

The suicide of Vladimir Zinovievich Nechay, director of the
Chelyabinsk-70 Federal Nuclear Center, shocked Russians and is viewed as
a deliberate elimination of the country’s scientific elite by the
regime. The event is seen as a tragedy stemming from the regime’s
disregard for scientists, particularly given the center’s privileged
status and subsequent devaluation of its work. Older scientists in
cities like Chelyabinsk faced hardship due to lack of funding, support,
and purpose, leading to immense stress and a sense of being abandoned by

1996-11-04 - <b> M. Mamikonyan </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, written in 1996, analyzes the tumultuous political landscape
of Russia following the presidential elections and the rise of regional
power. It argues that the elections, occurring amidst an economic crisis
and widespread disillusionment, have created a deeply ambiguous and
unstable situation. Key themes include the growing assertiveness of
regional governors, many of whom openly challenge the authority of the
central government, particularly in Moscow.

The author highlights a breakdown in trust and a lack of effective
governance, fueled by corruption, economic hardship, and a perceived
inability of the central government to address pressing issues. Regional
governors are actively seeking greater autonomy, often in defiance of
constitutional norms, and engaging in direct dealings with foreign
entities.

Furthermore, the text expresses concern about the lack of a strong,
centralized state capable of maintaining order and stability. It
suggests that the situation is characterized by a “gray zone” of
competing loyalties and a dangerous erosion of the foundations of the
Russian Federation. The author’s tone is critical of both the central
government’s weakness and the regional governors’ disregard for national
unity.

</p>
<p>

This text presents a highly fragmented and speculative picture of Russia
in November 1994, dominated by internal power struggles, covert
operations, and shifting geopolitical alliances. Key themes include
Boris Yeltsin’s deteriorating health and the manipulation of his image
by the presidential administration, particularly through the
controversial treatment of businessman Boris Nemtsov.

There’s a significant focus on power plays within Yeltsin’s inner
circle, with Anatoly Chubais orchestrating numerous schemes – including
attempts to discredit Vladimir Lukov, manipulate the political
landscape, and potentially install a new prime minister (Potanin).

Several factions are vying for influence: Berezovsky, leveraging
connections within Chechnya and Israel, while simultaneously attempting
to establish a dual citizenship; Chubais, utilizing his network to
destabilize the government and influence key figures; and various
intelligence agencies (FSB, SVR, GRU) engaged in clandestine operations.

The situation in Chechnya is portrayed as a key battleground, with the
conflict fueling broader destabilization efforts. There’s a clear
narrative of external actors – Turkey, Israel, and potentially Saudi
Arabia – exploiting the chaos for their own strategic gains.

The text details a complex web of meetings and gatherings, including
secret summits at Chubais’s dacha, suggesting a desperate attempt to
manage the crisis. A significant event is the bombing on the day of the
Moscow Police Day, linked to a potential Yeltsin resignation and further
orchestrated by Chubais’s group. Finally, the text highlights the
growing influence of Chechen militants and the potential for increased
instability.

<p>
Vladimir Strahov, a Russian academic, and his prolonged hunger strike to
protest the neglect of domestic science by the government, concluded
after a 12-day action coinciding with significant public protests.
Strahov and his colleague, Igor Nauchno-Bondarenko, initiated the strike
to highlight the severe underfunding of scientific institutions,
particularly compared to other sectors like extractive industries. They
achieved several key outcomes, including the government returning a
significant portion of unpaid debts to science and a noticeable increase
in scientific activity following the protests. However, the government’s
response was characterized by a lack of genuine engagement and a
continued prioritization of other sectors, leading Strahov to view the
situation as requiring ongoing, persistent protest. He criticized the
government’s deliberate misrepresentation of scientific funding and its
failure to uphold legal obligations. The strike aimed to secure a
minimum of 4% of the federal budget for science, a figure significantly
lower than the actual allocation. Strahov’s actions were driven by a
belief that science is crucial for the country’s future and that the
government’s actions were detrimental to national progress. He planned
to continue the protest if the government did not address the
fundamental issues of funding and recognition for scientific endeavors.

</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-11-11 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, dated November 12, 1996, analyzes the challenges facing
President Bill Clinton following his election victory. It argues that
Clinton is inheriting a deeply flawed situation, marked by economic
decline, strategic failures in international trade and military affairs,
and a growing global shift in power.

The core argument is that Clinton is adopting a strategy influenced by
Republican ideas, essentially acknowledging the need to adapt to a
changing world order. He’s shifting away from traditional American
hegemony and embracing a “virtual state” model – focusing on technology,
knowledge, and services rather than traditional industrial production.

Key concerns highlighted include: the declining competitiveness of the
US economy against rising powers like China and Europe; the expansion of
NATO, seen as a destabilizing force; and the rise of China as a dominant
economic and potentially geopolitical power.

Clinton’s strategy involves a significant shift in US foreign policy,
including a move away from traditional military dominance and a
willingness to engage with the ideas of Republican thinkers like Richard
Rosekrans, who advocate for a focus on technological leadership. The
text suggests that this shift will involve a weakening of Russia’s
position, potentially through pressure to abandon the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START II) and a continued expansion of NATO.
Ultimately, the text portrays Clinton as a pragmatic leader forced to
adapt to a new global landscape, influenced by a Republican vision of a
“virtual state.”

</p>
<p>

This text, dated November 12, 1996, analyzes the challenges facing
President Yeltsin following his heart surgery and the issuance of the
“Day of Reconciliation” decree. It argues that Yeltsin’s new position,
while possessing formal legitimacy, is deeply problematic due to a
combination of factors: a severely diminished public tolerance, a
failing economy, and a highly polarized political landscape.

The core argument is that Yeltsin’s attempts to rebuild trust and forge
a national consensus are hampered by his own actions – particularly his
manipulative use of social divisions during the 1996 election campaign –
and the deeply ingrained skepticism surrounding his leadership. The text
highlights the risks associated with attempting to implement significant
social and economic reforms without addressing the underlying issues of
economic hardship and political distrust.

Furthermore, it identifies specific obstacles, including the influence
of figures like Chubais and Chernomyrdin, who are viewed with suspicion
due to their past roles and the perception that they are consolidating
power independently of the president. The text emphasizes the need for
Yeltsin to undertake a genuine “redemption” – a difficult and
potentially painful process – to restore faith in his leadership and
achieve a lasting reconciliation within Russian society. It concludes
with a pessimistic assessment of Yeltsin’s prospects, acknowledging the
immense challenges he faces and the critical need for him to demonstrate
a fundamental shift in his approach.

This letter, written in 1996, expresses deep frustration and
disillusionment with Moscow’s influence and direction of Russia. The
author, a rural farmer, argues that Moscow has corrupted Russia,
prioritizing Western values and foreign interests over the needs of its
people. He criticizes Moscow’s role in fostering economic inequality,
promoting moral decay, and undermining traditional Russian identity.

The letter details specific grievances, including Moscow’s manipulation
of the media, its encouragement of corruption, and its disregard for the
plight of rural communities. It accuses Moscow of fostering a
materialistic culture, promoting foreign influences, and essentially
betraying the nation’s values. The author expresses a longing for a
return to traditional Russian identity and a rejection of Moscow’s
destructive influence. He uses historical parallels, such as the Seven
Boyars, to illustrate the ongoing pattern of Moscow’s betrayal.
Ultimately, the letter is a passionate plea for Russia to reclaim its

1996-11-11 - <b> Aleksandr Gordeyev </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, written in November 1996, analyzes the complex and precarious
situation in Russia following the re-election of Bill Clinton and the
departure of Boris Yeltsin. It highlights the hopes of the Yeltsin
administration for continued Western financial support, including
canceled IMF loans and eased pressure regarding NATO expansion, Iranian
nuclear cooperation, and the Chechen conflict. However, the author
argues that these hopes are fragile and based on a highly unstable
political landscape.

The core of the analysis centers on the influence of figures like Sergei
Chubais and Yevgeny Lukov within the Kremlin, who are skillfully
maneuvering to maintain power amidst growing regional tensions and
separatist sentiments. Lukov, as leader of the Federation Council, is
actively challenging Chubais’s monetary policies and advocating for
greater regional autonomy, supported by a coalition of governors.

The text paints a picture of a deeply divided Russia, with competing
factions – Chubais’s financial team versus the regional governors –
vying for control. The author suggests several potential political
scenarios for Yeltsin, ranging from a radical shift away from the IMF to
a more conservative approach. Ultimately, the text concludes that the
political landscape is highly volatile, with the outcome dependent on
the actions of key figures and the continued struggle between central
control and regional independence. The impending губернские (regional)
elections and the formation of the new Federation Council are seen as
critical junctures that could significantly alter the course of Russian
politics.

This text is a scathing and sarcastic critique of a greeting from Deputy
Sergei Govorukhina marking the 79th anniversary of the October
Revolution. Govorukhina’s message is riddled with contradictions,
historical inaccuracies, and illogical arguments. He repeatedly asserts
that the revolution has been detrimental to Russia, citing fabricated
statistics about population size (claiming 400 million Russians instead
of the actual figure), falsely alleging that the German army would have
been defeated in 1941, and dismissing any positive outcomes of the
revolution like increased literacy or technological advancement.

Govorukhina’s logic is consistently flawed, relying on speculative
“facts” and ignoring historical realities. He attempts to discredit the
revolution by highlighting negative consequences, such as the loss of
millions of soldiers in WWII, and uses a dismissive tone, questioning
the very possibility of a better outcome had the revolution not

This text is a cynical and pessimistic commentary on contemporary
Russia, arguing that a new form of fascism is emerging, mirroring the
rise of Nazism but utilizing more subtle and technologically advanced
methods. The author believes that Russia is heading towards a collapse
driven by misguided leadership, economic policies, and a general lack of
critical awareness.

The piece critiques figures like Yegor Gaidar, Vladimir Putin, and the
influence of Western advisors like George Soros and the IMF. It suggests
that Russia’s problems stem from a failure to learn from history,
particularly the rise of Nazism, and that the current leadership is
actively facilitating this process.

The author expresses concern about the manipulation of public opinion
through media control, the exploitation of national identity, and the
erosion of traditional values. They portray a bleak future where Russia
will be reduced to a shadow of its former self, mirroring the fate of
Germany before World War II.

Ultimately, the text is a warning against complacency and a call for

<p>
This text is a biographical portrait of Boris Sveshnikov, a Russian
artist who developed a distinctive style of illustrating fantastical,
often melancholic, scenes, particularly of European cities. Sveshnikov’s
artistic journey is marked by a solitary, almost obsessive, dedication
to his craft, beginning with a childhood fascination with the
illustrations in E.T.A. Hoffmann’s “The Nutcracker and Mouse King.” He
spent nearly twenty years in a Soviet labor camp after being implicated
in a terrorist organization, an experience that profoundly shaped his
worldview and artistic output. During his imprisonment, he created a
series of drawings depicting the harsh realities of camp life, blending
them with fantastical imagery, influenced by Flemish masters like Bosch
and Bruegel. Despite being largely overlooked by the Soviet art
establishment and later associated with the “second Russian avant-garde”
due to the recognition of his camp drawings by figures like Glezer and
Shemyakin, Sveshnikov remained fiercely independent and uninterested in
fame or political affiliation. He viewed his art as a personal
exploration of existence, a solitary journey through an unpredictable
world, and expressed a deep skepticism about humanity’s ability to
control its own destiny. The text concludes with an acknowledgment of
Sveshnikov’s wife, Olga Sergeevna, for providing the visual materials.

<p>

This text is a bleak and cynical portrayal of life in Electrostal, a
city near Moscow, in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet
Union. It depicts a community struggling with economic hardship,
corruption, and a sense of hopelessness. The city’s industrial base has
been decimated, leading to widespread unemployment and a decline in
living standards. There’s a pervasive feeling of being exploited and
ignored by the government.

The narrative focuses on the decline of traditional Soviet values and
the rise of a morally ambiguous, market-driven society. The author
highlights the disconnect between the promises of a new Russia and the
reality experienced by ordinary people. There’s a strong sense of
disillusionment and a critique of the emerging capitalist system, which
is seen as prioritizing profit over people’s well-being.

Key themes include the loss of community, the breakdown of social safety
nets, and the erosion of national identity. The text uses vivid imagery
and anecdotal stories to convey a sense of despair and to expose the
dark side of Russia’s transition to a market economy. The author’s tone

This text recounts the final days and death of Skhimnik Simeon (formerly
Dimitry, then Simeon), a solitary monk at the Trinity-Sergiev Lavra in
1977. Simeon, known for his unwavering devotion and physical strength,
lived a life of austere simplicity, enduring a debilitating illness with
remarkable patience and serenity. A young novice, Ioann, witnessed a
miraculous event – Simeon’s sudden revival – and later predicted his own
death alongside the elder’s. Ioann, a dedicated and devout servant,
ultimately died shortly after Simeon’s passing, having foreseen his
fate. The narrative emphasizes the profound spiritual significance of
Simeon’s life and death, highlighting the importance of prayer, faith,
and the interconnectedness of souls. It draws upon traditional Christian
beliefs regarding the soul’s journey after death, including the
forty-day period of purgatorial wandering, the final judgment, and the
necessity of prayers and offerings for the departed. The text concludes
with a reflection on the enduring power of prayer for both the living
and the dead, emphasizing the reciprocal relationship between believers
and the deceased.

Efremov’s Team Stars
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-11-25 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text details the corruption and cronyism surrounding the
gubernatorial campaign of Anatoly Efremov in the Arkhangelsk region of
Russia during the 1996 election. Vladimir Krupchak, a businessman who
rapidly amassed wealth through exploiting privatization under Yegor
Gaidar and subsequent deals, became a key financial backer of Efremov’s
campaign. Krupchak’s wealth was built on exploiting loopholes and
manipulating the market, initially through supplying energy to the
region and later through controlling key industries like the Arkhangelsk
Cellulose and Paper Plant (ACBC).

He achieved this through a network of corruption involving regional
officials, including the then-Governor Pavel Balakshin and the head of
the property management committee, Sergei Potemkin, as well as
leveraging the influence of his wife, who worked at the Moscow
Industrial Bank (MINB). Krupchak’s empire expanded through acquiring
companies like “Titan,” “Batifi,” and eventually controlling the ACBC,
all facilitated by preferential access to loans and manipulated
auctions.

Crucially, Krupchak’s support for Efremov was fueled by a complex web of
personal relationships and financial incentives, exemplified by the
scandalous acquisition of a luxury apartment by the head of the medical
academy, Pavel Sidorov, who used funds allocated for medical academy
housing. The text highlights the systemic corruption, the exploitation
of public resources, and the close ties between political figures and
powerful businessmen, ultimately demonstrating how these connections
were used to secure victory in the election.

Sold brigades
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-11-25 - <b> Sergey Kurginyan </b>
</p>
<p>

This analytical report critiques the actions of businessman Boris
Березовский regarding the withdrawal of the 101st and 205th brigades
from Chechnya. The author argues that Березовский’s involvement was
driven purely by profit motives, exploiting a situation where the
brigades were deemed strategically weak and a hindrance to negotiations.
He characterizes Березовsky’s approach as a cynical “trade” – selling
off the brigades for a commission, mirroring a pattern of Soviet-era
corruption where strategic assets were sold off to Western interests.

The core argument is that Березовsky’s actions demonstrated a
fundamental lack of strategic thinking and a disregard for Russia’s
national interests. He saw the brigades as a commodity to be traded,
rather than as vital components of a military strategy. The author
highlights the parallels between this situation and previous Soviet
practices of “selling” strategic assets to foreign powers.

Ultimately, the report concludes that Березовsky’s actions were driven
by short-term gain and lacked any genuine commitment to Russia’s
strategic position in Chechnya. The author expresses concern that this
type of opportunistic behavior, devoid of a broader strategic vision,
will continue to plague the Russian business and political landscape.

This text outlines a complex and rapidly shifting power struggle within
Russia in late 1996/early 1997, primarily driven by a faction led by
Yegor Chernomyrdin and supported by figures like Boris Berezovsky and
Vladimir Gusiev (later known as Yegor Chernomyrdin). This group is
actively challenging President Yeltsin’s authority and attempting to
reshape the Russian economy and political landscape. Key elements
include: a power struggle between Chernomyrdin and the new, dominant
group led by Chubais, Berezovsky, and Potanin; attempts to influence key
industries like energy (specifically RAE “Yuzhuralmash” and
“Yuzhuralmash”), banking (including prominent banks like Credo-Bank and
AgroPromBank), and telecommunications (“RosTelecom” and “Svyazinvest”);
strategic interventions in regions like Tatarstan and Bashkortostan,
fueled by concerns about separatist movements and potential foreign
influence; and a deliberate effort to undermine Yeltsin’s control
through financial manipulation, asset seizures, and the manipulation of
key economic decisions. The text highlights a series of calculated moves
designed to consolidate power within a small group, often at the expense
of established institutions and Yeltsin’s authority, with significant

The text discusses the significance of church construction in Russia,
particularly focusing on the contrast between traditional,
spiritually-oriented church building and modern, technologically
advanced structures. It argues that a historical disconnect exists
between the ideal of a church representing Russian statehood and its
actual manifestation. The author critiques the current trend of building
secular structures and advocates for a return to “sofiianity” – a
traditional understanding of church architecture and its role in
representing Russian state power and spiritual connection. The
construction of churches like the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral in
Gubkinsk is seen as a tentative step, while the destruction of
historical churches, such as the Sofia Cathedral in Novgorod, symbolizes
a rejection of this connection. The author expresses concern about the
current political and economic climate and its impact on spiritual
values, suggesting that a return to sofiianity is necessary to address
the perceived imbalance.

</p>
<p>

This text outlines a critical analysis of the “Rozdory” agreement
between Chernomyrdin and Maschado in Chechnya, arguing it was a
fundamentally flawed and ultimately detrimental political move. The core
argument is that the agreement, signed in 1996, was constitutionally
unsound – a breach of the Russian Federation’s status as a
constitutional federation and a dangerous precursor to Chechnya’s
eventual secession.

The author contends that the agreement, driven by political expediency,
was a strategic error. The initial proposals for a vote of no confidence
in the government and impeachment against President Yeltsin were
misguided, failing to recognize the agreement’s inherent illegality.

Furthermore, the text criticizes the use of manipulated public opinion
polls (from VCIOM) and the pressure exerted on the opposition to accept
the agreement. It suggests that the opposition’s tactics were ultimately
self-defeating, potentially leading to their marginalization and
weakening their position.

The author advocates for a more strategic approach: delaying any formal
decisions until after regional elections, engaging local legislative
bodies in the discussion, and potentially offering amnesty to key
figures involved. The ultimate goal is to mobilize public support
against the fragmentation of Russia and to prevent the opposition from
being further weakened. The author believes that a carefully
orchestrated strategy, focused on local engagement and a calculated
delay, offers the best chance for the opposition to regain momentum and
ultimately achieve its objectives.

</p>
<p>

This text explores the resilience of the Serbian people in Bosnia
following the Bosnian War, examining their motivations for continued
resistance and the broader implications for societal conflict. The
author argues that Serbian strength stems primarily from a potent
combination of national identity, religious faith (specifically Orthodox
Christianity), and a deeply ingrained sense of purpose.

The piece details the ongoing influence of Radovan Karadzic, portraying
him as a charismatic and unifying figure, and highlights the role of
religious belief – particularly prayer and ritual – in bolstering morale
and providing a framework for action. It draws historical parallels,
referencing the Huguenots, Cromwell’s Puritan army, and the power of
religious unity in shaping military success.

The author suggests that Russia’s own future may lie in embracing a
similar “national Russian and Orthodox” identity, arguing that a strong,
faith-based state could effectively counter the perceived “new world
order.” Ultimately, the text posits that the key to overcoming
challenges lies not in economic or technological superiority, but in
harnessing the enduring power of national identity and religious
conviction.

This text argues that the Western criticism of the Belarusian referendum
is a deliberate attempt to undermine Alexander Lukashenko’s authority.
The author believes Western powers, fearing Lukashenko’s direct appeal
to the people, are portraying the referendum as a dictatorial attempt to
gain excessive power. Instead, the author contends the referendum is a
genuine expression of Belarusian democracy, modeled after a “veche”
system, and a response to Western manipulation.

The author attributes Lukashenko’s recent difficulties to his own
mistakes – engaging in unproductive arguments with the opposition and
surrounding himself with unreliable advisors. He stresses the importance
of maintaining a strong connection with the people and resisting Western
provocations, suggesting a long-term strategy of patience and decisive
action is necessary to preserve Lukashenko’s power. The text concludes
with a pessimistic outlook, predicting continued Western attempts to
destabilize Lukashenko, and advising a patient, strategic response.

March on Moscow!
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-12-02 - <b> Viktor Anpilov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text outlines a plan for a massive, nationwide protest movement
aimed at forcing a change in the Yeltsin government. It details the
reasoning behind the movement – the government’s corruption, economic
mismanagement, and disregard for the people’s needs. The core strategy
involves organizing a “march on Moscow” led by the “Labor Russia”
movement, spearheaded by Viktor Anpilov.

The plan hinges on creating a nationwide “All-Union Strike Committee”
(All-Union Strike Committee – All-Union Strike Committee) composed of
representatives from trade unions, worker collectives, and other
opposition groups. This committee would coordinate the massive
demonstration, demanding the government change its course or resign.

Anpilov argues that traditional parliamentary methods are ineffective
against the “predatory” Yeltsin regime. He stresses the need for a
direct, forceful response from the working class. He references a
previous, unsuccessful attempt to influence the government through a
similar tactic, highlighting the importance of widespread, organized
action.

The text emphasizes the need for a grassroots movement, driven by the
collective grievances of the people, rather than relying solely on
political leaders. It suggests that the success of the movement depends
on mobilizing support across various regions and worker groups,
ultimately aiming to exert pressure on the government through a massive,
unified demonstration.

A complex geopolitical scenario unfolds, driven by the ambitions of

Chubays, who are manipulating the Russian political landscape. The core
of the issue revolves around the Caspian Pipeline project, specifically
a proposed route through Georgia, designed to circumvent traditional
Russian control over oil transit and ultimately diminish Russia’s
influence in Central Asia. This project is fueled by personal interests,
strategic maneuvering, and a broader ideological shift towards
Western-aligned influence within Russia. The potential consequences
include the rapid disintegration of Russia, beginning with Chechnya and
extending to other regions, coupled with a destabilizing effect on the
global order. Key players are actively seeking to replace Chubays with
figures more aligned with their interests, creating a situation where
control over Russia is increasingly uncertain and potentially

<p>

This text details the complex and turbulent situation in Primorye,
Russia, in the mid-1990s, primarily focusing on the conflict between
Governor Evgeny Nazratenko and Mayor Viktor Cherepkov. The region is
portrayed as a chaotic “battleground” manipulated by Moscow, used as a
testing ground for “disassembly technologies.”

Nazratenko, appointed during a period of economic crisis and separatist
sentiment, faced constant interference and attempts to undermine his
authority. Moscow utilized a strategy of creating division, exemplified
by artificially inflated energy prices, manipulated transportation
costs, and the deliberate neglect of Primorye’s strategic importance –
its naval base, defense industry, and role as a gateway to Asia.

Cherepkov, capitalizing on this instability, sought to separate
Vladivostok from the region, arguing that it was being systematically
drained of resources and investment by Moscow. He employed a tactic of
grievance and discontent, fueled by high energy prices, transportation
costs, and the neglect of the region’s strategic assets.

The situation was further complicated by Moscow’s shifting allegiances,
with different factions – Korzhakov-Sosovets, Ilushin, and Chubais –
vying for control and employing contradictory policies. Ultimately, the
text suggests that Primorye was being deliberately “killed” through
these manipulations, representing a failed experiment in regional
governance and a demonstration of Moscow’s willingness to exploit
regional tensions for its own purposes.

</p>
<p>

This text, dated November 10-12, 1996, discusses the growing trend of
Russian regions establishing their own financial systems, effectively
creating “surrogate money” to operate independently of the central
government. Several regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan, and others,
are issuing расчетно-товарные чеки (transaction receipts), eurobonds,
and even establishing their own customs services to achieve financial
autonomy.

The article expresses concern that this trend, driven by a desire for
self-determination and fueled by dissatisfaction with central government
policies, is creating a dangerous precedent. It highlights the potential
for regional financial separatism and the disruption of Russia’s
economic and political stability.

The author criticizes the central government’s approach, led by figures
like Chernomyrdin and, increasingly, Chubais, which attempts to control
regional financial activity but is perceived as lagging behind the
regions’ efforts. There’s a debate about whether this regional financial
independence is a necessary step towards greater autonomy or a
destabilizing force. The article suggests that the creation of these
regional financial systems could ultimately lead to the emergence of
political boundaries and a fragmented Russia. It concludes with a note
of caution, questioning whether this trend represents a foundation for

This text outlines a complex and highly contested political situation in
Russia during the mid-1990s, driven by a concerted effort by Western
financial and political groups, primarily through figures like George

reshape the country. The core strategy involved leveraging relationships
with figures like Boris Berezovsky and Viktor Chernomyrdin, aiming to
dismantle the “Natural Monopolies” system, discredit opposition leader
Zyunov and the CPRF, and ultimately, dismantle the Yeltsin
administration.

Key elements include:

-   **Western Influence:** The US government, through figures like
    Clintons, Albright, and the broader group associated with George
    Soros, was actively directing events, providing recommendations and
    funding to groups like Chubais-Berezovsky.
-   **Strategic Goals:** The overarching goal was to restructure Russia

    like oil and gas.
-   **Tactics:** This involved manipulating political divisions,
    undermining the legitimacy of the government, and supporting

-   **Internal Conflicts:** The text highlights a struggle within Russia

-   **Disinformation and Propaganda:** The media, particularly NTV and

</p>
<p>

This text is a collection of articles and commentary surrounding the
1997 Russian federal budget proposal and the government’s actions (or
lack thereof) regarding its implementation. The core argument is that
the government, under President Yeltsin, is deliberately creating a
disastrous economic situation – low social spending, unpaid debts, and a
failing economy – to maintain control and appease international
financial institutions like the IMF.

The articles highlight a pattern of the government ignoring Duma
(parliament) approval of the budget, prioritizing foreign influence and
personal enrichment over the well-being of the Russian people. There’s a
strong critique of the IMF’s role in exacerbating the situation and a
sense of urgency regarding the potential for widespread poverty and
social unrest.

Several key points are repeatedly emphasized: the government’s
unwillingness to increase the budget significantly, the manipulation of
figures to justify poor spending decisions, and the lack of
accountability. The articles express concern that the Duma’s approval of
the current budget would effectively legitimize this destructive course
and silence any opposition. The final article emphasizes the potential
for the Duma to reject the budget and calls for a new, people-centered
budget to be developed.

This text is a firsthand account and commentary by military journalist
Boris Karpov regarding the Chechen conflict and the role of generals,
particularly Anatoly Romanov and Nikolai Skripnik. It expresses a
critical perspective on politicians and the media, portraying them as
often misguided and exploitative of the military’s sacrifices.

Karpov highlights the importance of experienced, principled officers,
emphasizing their understanding of military strategy, their respect for

soldiers over personal ambition. He criticizes the tendency of
politicians to treat generals as pawns, and the media’s often

responsibilities involved. It recounts specific instances, such as the
tragic death of General Skripnik and the bravery of Anatoly Romanov,
illustrating these qualities.

Ultimately, Karpov conveys a strong sense of respect for the Russian

About the war with Finland

<p>
1996-12-16 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a Stalinist analysis of the Finnish War, delivered as a
speech in 1940. It argues that the Soviet Union’s victory wasn’t simply
a defeat of Finland, but a broader triumph over the military strategies
and technologies of Western European powers, particularly Germany,
France, and England. Stalin emphasizes the strategic importance of
securing Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) as the primary motivation for
the war, framing it as a necessary measure to safeguard the Soviet
Union’s core territory and industrial base.

He criticizes the Soviet military’s initial shortcomings, attributing
them to a culture of excessive boasting and a misplaced faith in an
invincible army, stemming from the experiences of the preceding Civil
War. Stalin highlights the importance of learning from these mistakes
and adapting to modern warfare, emphasizing the need for mass artillery,
air power, and a more disciplined approach.

The speech concludes by asserting that the Soviet victory demonstrated
the superiority of Soviet military thinking and strategy over those of
the Western powers, a key element of Soviet propaganda at the time. It
was a justification for the war and a demonstration of Soviet strength.

RED THOUGHT and BLACK SWING

<p>

This text is a pessimistic analysis of the political and economic
situation in Russia in late 1996, primarily focusing on the implications
of the Duma’s initial approval of the federal budget. It argues that
this approval, largely driven by the influence of figures like Chubais
and Berezovsky, effectively seals the fate of the National Salvation
Front (NPS) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPR).

The core argument is that the Duma’s vote solidifies a disastrous course
of economic policy – a shift towards privatization and monetary control
– spearheaded by these powerful figures. The text predicts a rapid loss
of influence for the NPS and CPR, leading to their marginalization and
eventual fragmentation.

Key concerns highlighted include: the dominance of a financial bloc
(Chubais-Berezovsky) within the government, the potential for increased
instability due to this group’s actions (such as the use of emergency
measures like VCHK – a reference to the former Soviet system of tax
collection), and the likely erosion of the Duma’s role as a check on
executive power.

The text suggests a bleak outlook for the opposition, forecasting a
scenario where they become trapped between a forced vote of no
confidence and a complete capitulation to the government. It emphasizes
the importance of the Council of Federation and regional leaders in
challenging this course, anticipating a significant shift in political
power dynamics in the coming months, particularly around March-April
1997. Ultimately, the text paints a picture of a Russia rapidly moving
towards a highly unstable and controlled economic system, with the
opposition effectively sidelined.

This text is a collection of fragmented anecdotes and observations
surrounding Boris Yeltsin and his associates, primarily focusing on the
chaotic and often absurd political landscape of post-Soviet Russia. It’s
presented as a series of loosely connected stories, often employing dark
humor and exaggeration.

The core narrative revolves around Yeltsin’s personality – a
contradictory figure who simultaneously embraced democratic ideals while
exhibiting erratic behavior, including bizarre moments like addressing a
toilet with a rose, confusing a translator, and engaging in nonsensical
conversations.

Key figures like Gennady Zyuganov, Alexander Korzhakov, and the “gray
cardinal” Pavel Shuayev are depicted with a mixture of skepticism and
amusement. The text highlights the confusion and contradictions within
the Yeltsin administration, portraying them as a group of individuals
prone to missteps, bizarre pronouncements, and a general lack of
understanding.

Recurring themes include the struggle to define Yeltsin’s political
identity, the absurdity of political maneuvering, and the tendency for
figures to be misidentified or misrepresented. The text uses a satirical
tone, particularly when describing figures like Gaidar (a beloved but
enigmatic figure), and employs a stream-of-consciousness style, jumping
between observations and reflections. Ultimately, the text presents a
portrait of a Russia grappling with its transition to democracy, marked
by instability, confusion, and a healthy dose of self-deprecating humor.

The text is a rambling, somewhat cynical reflection on a conference
celebrating the poet Nikolai Nekrasov, delivered at a theatrical event
showcasing items from his estate, Karabikh. The speaker expresses
frustration with the state of Russian culture and the preservation of
historical sites, highlighting the neglect of Nekrasov’s legacy and the
broader issues of cultural preservation in post-Soviet Russia.

He critiques the superficiality of the event and the political
maneuvering surrounding it, referencing figures like Andrei Yakovlev and
subtly criticizing the “architects of perestroika.” The speaker
repeatedly returns to Nekrasov’s sayings, using them as a lens to
examine contemporary Russian society and its problems. He expresses
concern about the treatment of cultural artifacts and the tendency to
prioritize political appearances over genuine engagement with history
and art. The entire speech is punctuated by a stream of observations,
questions, and digressions, ultimately serving as a lament for a lost
cultural heritage and a critique of the current state of Russia.

In 1995, Lieutenant M. Yaszhenko, commanding a platoon in the 503rd
motorized rifle battalion during the Chechen conflict, surrendered to
militants after his soldiers expressed a desire to lay down their arms.
While the remaining soldiers continued to fight, Yaszhenko and
approximately a dozen of his men were taken prisoner. He was
subsequently charged with multiple articles of the Russian Criminal
Code, including insubordination and abuse of power, leading to a public
outcry and accusations of a “noble” act by media outlets like
“Izvestia,” despite the circumstances. The case involved conflicting
accounts between witnesses, the media, and military authorities, with
Yaszhenko claiming he was following orders to leave the battlefield.
Ultimately, the charges were dropped due to the post-Soviet context and
a 50th-anniversary amnesty, with Yaszhenko’s release facilitated by
legal maneuvering and the involvement of human rights organizations. The
situation remains ambiguous, with questions about Yaszhenko’s future and
the attitudes of his former comrades.

<p>
1996-12-23 - <b> Sergey Kurginyan </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, written in 1996, is a highly critical and cynical analysis of
Boris Yeltsin’s presidency and the state of Russia. It argues that
Yeltsin is deeply unwell, both physically and politically, and that his
actions are leading the country towards a chaotic and destructive
future.

The author, S. Kurginyan, identifies several key threats: Alexander
Lebed’s manipulative influence, the rise of regional criminal barons and
warlords fueled by economic instability and regional conflicts
(particularly on the North Caucasus), and the disintegration of state
authority.

Lebed is portrayed as a master manipulator, gathering support from
regional elites and exploiting social unrest. The text highlights the
increasing fragmentation of Russia into competing regional powers, each
with its own agenda and often supported by criminal elements. The author
expresses concern about the potential for widespread violence and the
collapse of the state.

The piece suggests that Yeltsin’s leadership is failing to address these
challenges and that a “second revolution” – potentially violent and
destabilizing – is increasingly likely. It concludes with a bleak
assessment of the situation, suggesting that only a unified effort to
defend a centralized Russia can prevent further catastrophe. The author
expresses skepticism about Yeltsin’s ability to steer the country
towards a stable future.

</p>
<p>

This text recounts the tragic experiences of children caught in the
Chechen War, primarily focusing on a nine-year-old boy named Andreyushka
(Andryushka), a “son of the regiment.” Andreyushka, orphaned after his
parents were killed by Dudayev’s forces, survived by living on a
cemetery and eventually joining a military unit. He demonstrated
remarkable resourcefulness and combat skills at a young age, becoming
adept at using weapons and navigating dangerous situations.

The narrative highlights the widespread abandonment of children, many of
whom were forced into a state of servitude, often working as beggars and
scavengers for meager rations. Andreyushka’s story exemplifies the
profound trauma inflicted upon these children, who were essentially
thrust into a brutal, adult world. The text underscores the disturbing
reality of children becoming hardened by war, exhibiting a chillingly
pragmatic and mature understanding of survival at a young age. It raises
serious questions about the long-term psychological impact of this
conflict on these children and their potential futures, questioning
whether they will be able to escape the cycle of violence and trauma.

The Duma’s approval of the budget is seen as a tactical victory for the
“Chernomyrdin group” over Chubais, achieved through support from the
Duma’s left-wing majority. This is significant for Chubais, allowing him
to secure agreements with key groupings within the upper house and
“regional barons.” Yeltsin’s implication that Chubais doubted the Duma’s
budget approval, facilitated by the head of the Presidential
Administration through the LDPR faction, is also noted. Within Chechnya,
Maschadow and Basayev are predicted to receive roughly equal support
(30-35%). Maschadow’s support is confirmed by the Kremlin through key
figures like Rybak and Berezhovsky. The visit by Chinese Premier Li Peng
is viewed as part of a broader “temporary appeasement” strategy with the
US, without implying any political or military partnership. Defense
Minister Rodionov’s characterization of China as a security threat is
attributed to post-Semyonov scandal-related stress. Finally, the
increased political activity of former Security Council Secretary Lebed
is linked to a staged leak regarding Yeltsin’s health orchestrated by
Korzhakov.

Let’s move on to water procedures.
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1996-12-30 - <b> Aleksey Belyakov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the “Water Code” (VK) drafted in
Russia, arguing it’s fundamentally flawed due to its overly complex and
contradictory provisions. The author, an engineer-hydrologist, contends
the code prioritizes bureaucratic processes and vague legal definitions
over practical solutions and the established principles of water rights.

Key criticisms include:

-   **Misinterpretation of Historical Water Rights:** The code ignores
    the historical precedent of water being a common resource accessible
    to all citizens, regardless of social class, a principle established
    in the Russian Empire.
-   **Overly Complex Legal Definitions:** The code introduces artificial
    distinctions between “citizens” and “legal entities,” unnecessarily
    complicating the rights and responsibilities associated with water
    usage.
-   **Focus on Bureaucracy:** The author argues the code’s emphasis on
    procedures and regulations hinders effective water management and
    prioritizes administrative processes over practical solutions.
-   **Contradictory Provisions:** The text highlights numerous
    contradictions within the code, particularly regarding the
    definition of “water usage” and the rights of individuals versus
    those of “legal entities.”
-   **Ignoring Practical Considerations:** The author criticizes the
    code’s failure to address practical issues such as water pollution,
    the need for adequate infrastructure, and the importance of
    maintaining water as a common resource.

Ultimately, the author believes the “Water Code” is a poorly conceived
document that fails to uphold fundamental principles of water rights and
threatens to create further complications in water management.

This text, written in 1996, details the complex and ultimately fragile
peace negotiations surrounding the Tajik conflict. The core issue is the
uneasy agreement brokered between the Tajik government (led by Rahmonov)
and the Tajik opposition, facilitated by Russia. The article highlights
the parallels between the Tajik situation and the Chechen conflict,
emphasizing the concessions made by Rahmonov and the questionable nature
of any Russian “victory.”

The negotiations were fraught with distrust, with the opposition, led by
figures like Turadjonzon and Rabban, repeatedly demanding greater power
within the newly formed National Reconciliation Commission. The article
reveals a shifting landscape of alliances, with the emergence of a
“third force” – the Leninabad clan led by Abdulmalik Abdulojonov – who
gained significant influence and ultimately shaped the terms of the
agreement.

Key points include the constant instability, marked by terrorist attacks
and the involvement of various factions including the Taliban and
Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan. The article questions the
long-term viability of the agreements, noting the ambiguous nature of
the reconciliation commission and the potential for a return to
conflict, particularly concerning the distribution of power, wealth, and
the integration of former combatants. It concludes that Russia’s role in
Tajikistan is only just beginning, and that the success of the
negotiations hinges on the outcome of upcoming elections and the ability

This text recounts the disastrous and frustrating experience of
classical musician Konstantin Mережников after being struck by a
hit-and-run driver at a wedding reception in Moscow in 1996. The story
unfolds through Mережников’s perspective, detailing a series of
missteps, inadequate medical care, and bureaucratic indifference
following the accident.

Initially, he suffers a severe head injury and is left in a chaotic
state at a hospital, receiving inconsistent and ultimately unhelpful
treatment from a potentially intoxicated neurologist. He faces delays,
dismissive attitudes from medical staff, and a general lack of
coordination.

The narrative highlights the absurdity of the situation, with Mережников
encountering a revolving door of unresponsive medical professionals, a
frustrating bureaucratic process involving multiple departments and
committees, and a general sense of being ignored and abandoned.

Despite his injuries and distress, he attempts to navigate the complex
system, seeking help from his wife, the Committee for Health of Moscow,
and ultimately, leaving the hospital feeling defeated and without proper
care. The story serves as a darkly comedic and cynical portrayal of a
system failing to provide adequate assistance to a vulnerable
