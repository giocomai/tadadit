Despite Russia still being “ahead of the planet” in space exploration,
the Russian space program is struggling due to minimal government
funding, hindering its involvement with the International Space Station
(ISS). The ISS increasingly relies on Russia, with Russian “Soyuz” and
“Progress” spacecraft delivering astronauts and cargo. Concerns arose
about Russia potentially halting ISS access due to a lack of funding,
but this was averted through commercial contracts with NASA. Russia is
developing its own reusable spacecraft, the “Klіper,” which is cheaper
and more adaptable than American counterparts. Despite these efforts,
the Russian government has prioritized self-funding over adequate
investment, raising concerns about the future of the Russian space
program and its continued participation in the ISS.

</p>
<p>
Dmitry Rogozin argues that preferential energy prices with partners are
only justifiable when those partners are aligning with Russia
politically, such as joining a Russian confederation or receiving
services like transit or military base support. He criticizes
preferential pricing with countries like the Baltic states and Georgia,
citing concerns about Russian-speaking minorities and anti-Russian
policies. Regarding Ukraine, he believes gas tariffs should have been
adjusted after Ukraine’s pro-European orientation, but instead, Russia
effectively funded NATO infrastructure. Rogozin expresses frustration
with inconsistent messaging from Gazprom and a lack of clear political
strategy in Russia’s energy policy, predicting alternative energy supply
routes if Russia continues with its current approach. He supports the
resulting compromise in Ukraine but warns it could damage Russia’s
geopolitical interests and aligns with the long-held view of patriotic
opposition regarding fair energy prices based on a country’s political
alignment.

The text is a nostalgic and somewhat bitter reflection on the author’s
experiences and observations, primarily centered around the construction
of the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhorod gas pipeline and the subsequent disputes
between Russia and Ukraine. The author, a former employee of
“Komsomolskaya Pravda,” recounts his involvement in documenting the

symbol of Soviet unity and prosperity extending across Eastern Europe
and beyond. He expresses frustration with the current situation,
particularly the conflict between Gazprom and Naftogaz, viewing it as a
betrayal of the original spirit of cooperation and the “morning gong”
that inspired the project. He laments the lack of a similar rallying
call in Russia today and expresses a sense of disillusionment with the

REMEMBERANCE OF THE REVOLT

</p>
<p>
In 2005, a protest in Solnechnyorsk, Russia, involving pensioners
blocking a highway, began as a reaction to the monetization of pensions.
Organized by communists, the initial event quickly escalated with a
blockade and subsequent widespread protests across Russia, fueled by
concerns about the impact of reforms on citizens’ livelihoods. Despite
attempts by authorities to manage the situation, the protests continued,
and the government was forced to increase compensation funds. The events
raised concerns about a potential resurgence of these protests,
particularly due to further reforms impacting citizens’ living
standards.

This text is a cynical and conspiratorial analysis of the 2006-2009 “gas
war” between Russia and Ukraine, framing it as a deliberate manipulation
orchestrated by various actors, primarily the United States and internal
Russian elites. It argues that the conflict was not about energy
security but a calculated move to weaken Russia, fueled by a corrupt and
self-serving “neftechalnyy klass” (oil and gas class) within Russia. The
author contends that the conflict was a staged event, designed to
dismantle the legacy of the Russian state, manipulate public opinion,
and ultimately benefit American interests. It paints a picture of
widespread deception, corruption, and a deliberate attempt to create
lasting animosity between Russia and Ukraine, ultimately concluding that
the entire episode was a “gas bubble” – a temporary and ultimately
meaningless event driven by self-serving interests.

The author expresses deep dissatisfaction with the current state of
Russian literature, particularly the prevalence of explicit and often
gratuitous depictions of sexual encounters. He argues that many
contemporary writers are obsessed with portraying unrestrained lust,
seemingly stemming from a lack of genuine romantic experience. This
trend contrasts sharply with the profound and meaningful portrayals of
love found in classic Russian literature, which explore themes of
beauty, devotion, and spiritual connection. The author criticizes the
perceived lack of respect for women and the devaluation of genuine human
relationships, arguing that these writers are prioritizing
sensationalism over artistic merit. He laments the shift in literary
focus, expressing a desire for literature that celebrates true love and
elevates the human spirit, rather than indulging in excessive and often
vulgar depictions of sexuality.

VALENTIN SOROKIN’S EMPOWERING RISE
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2006-01-24 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a nostalgic recounting of a pivotal moment in the early
1970s when young poet Valentin Sorokin emerged from Moscow’s “catacombs”
– clandestine Russian literary circles. The author details how Sorokin’s
raw, passionate poetry, focused on themes of Russian identity and
national pride, captivated a group of intellectuals and poets who had
been largely suppressed by Soviet authorities.

The piece emphasizes the significance of Sorokin’s appearance at a
highly attended event organized by the VOOPIK (All-Russian Society for
the Preservation of History and Culture) and the Moscow City
Organization of the Writers’ Union. It describes the attendees as a
diverse group, including established figures like Yuri Prokushev and
Vladimir Soloukhin, alongside younger talents. The author recounts the
feeling of liberation and hope generated by Sorokin’s work, viewing it
as a crucial step towards reclaiming Russian cultural identity and a
small victory against the constraints of Soviet censorship. The text
highlights the role of figures like Vadim Kozhinov, who, despite
employing a strategy of “quiet lyricism” to manage and control these
poets, was ultimately seen as a necessary, albeit flawed, facilitator of
this cultural resurgence. The overall tone is one of profound admiration
for Sorokin’s impact and a bittersweet reflection on the tragic fates of
several of these poets who ultimately succumbed to the pressures of the
Soviet system.

SRMS - For the Military-Industrial Complex
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2006-01-31 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This article details a complex and potentially damaging information
campaign surrounding the “Orlov case,” a Russian national accused of
illegally supplying weapons to various countries, including Iran, China,
and Syria. The core argument is that this case is a deliberate attempt
by the United States and Israel to discredit and undermine Russia’s
legitimate arms exports and military-technical cooperation with nations
deemed “rogue states.”

The article outlines a series of questionable deals involving
Ukrainian-supplied weapons (primarily the Kh-55 cruise missiles) being
diverted to countries like Iran and China, facilitated by individuals
like Oleg Orlov. It highlights the pressure exerted by the US and Israel
to expose these deals, leading to the arrest and detention of Orlov in
the Czech Republic.

The narrative suggests a coordinated effort to portray Russia as a major
proliferator of weapons technology, despite legitimate arms sales
occurring with countries like Venezuela, Syria, and Iran. The article
emphasizes the potential consequences for Russian defense industry
enterprises, particularly the Izhmash factory and the Tor-M1 missile
system production at the “Krylaty Rakety” plant, if the accusations are
successfully used to halt or severely restrict these exports.

Furthermore, the piece suggests a deeper internal struggle within the US
government, with factions vying for influence and potentially using the
Orlov case as a tool to discredit Vice President Dick Cheney. The
article concludes by expressing concern that this campaign aims to
ultimately dismantle Russia’s defense industry and isolate it from
international partners.

Russian “Amazons”
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2006-02-14 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a highly personal and somewhat rambling narrative by Olga
Shakhareva, a woman in her late 50s living in Russia. She recounts a
series of experiences, primarily revolving around societal biases
against older, single women, particularly those with higher education.
Shakhareva expresses frustration with ageism, arguing that she and other
women like her are unfairly judged and excluded from opportunities due
to stereotypes about their capabilities and suitability for certain
jobs.

She details her childhood, emphasizing her strong work ethic and
academic achievements, contrasting this with the dismissive attitudes
she encountered later in life. She describes several instances where her
age was used against her – being denied a job despite her
qualifications, facing skepticism about her abilities, and experiencing
discrimination in various situations.

Shakhareva’s story is filled with anger and resentment towards a society
that she feels consistently undervalues and marginalizes older women.
She uses anecdotal evidence and personal experiences to illustrate her
point, frequently criticizing the tendency to blame women for societal
problems and to rely on outdated stereotypes. She expresses a desire for
recognition and respect, arguing that women of her generation possess
valuable skills and experience that should be utilized, not dismissed
based on age. The text concludes with a strong condemnation of ageist
attitudes and a plea for a more equitable society.

<p>

The text expresses a critical and disillusioned perspective on the
current state of “patriotic” sport in Russia, particularly in the
context of the Olympics. It argues that the focus on sports as a tool
for national pride has become distorted and manipulated by political
interests. The author, a former Soviet citizen, laments the shift away
from genuine sporting ideals towards a cynical attempt to use sporting
achievements to bolster the current regime.

The piece critiques the superficial nature of support for the
government, exemplified by athletes being bought and discarded after
achieving success, as seen with figures like Vladimir Krikunov and Irina
Slukskaya. It highlights the disconnect between the idealized vision of
Russia – rooted in history, culture, and natural resources – and the
reality of a “squeezed” economy and political system.

The author suggests that genuine sporting success will only flourish
when athletes are free from political pressure and manipulation, and
that the current system is fundamentally flawed. It ends with a somewhat
pessimistic observation about the state of the Russian people and their
willingness to engage with patriotic ideals.

2006-03-07 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, critical analysis of the “Shutov Case,” a
politically charged trial in St. Petersburg in 2001. It argues that Yuri
Shutov, a writer and former aide to the former St. Petersburg mayor, was
falsely accused of organizing a gang, multiple murders, and other
crimes. The core of the argument is that the evidence against Shutov is
flimsy, based on the unreliable and contradictory testimonies of several
convicted criminals (Rogozhnikov, Minakov, and Mikhaylov) who were
incentivized to fabricate evidence.

The author contends that the prosecution built a “myth” around Shutov,
using these dubious testimonies and unrelated crimes (including the
murder of a vodka trader and a businessman) to create a fabricated
narrative. The text highlights numerous inconsistencies and
contradictions within the case, particularly regarding the use of
explosive materials (hexogen) and the identification of victims. It
suggests that the trial was driven by political motives rather than
genuine evidence, and that Shutov was a victim of a politically
motivated frame-up. The author expresses skepticism about the entire
process, asserting that the case was built on lies and manipulation, and
that Shutov’s guilt was never proven.

attends a specialized legal-focused school. The school’s curriculum,
including lessons on property rights and future legal proceedings, is
presented as overly complex and focused on abstract legal concepts
rather than practical application. The narrative highlights the
absurdity of applying legal principles to a young child and critiques
the state of the Russian legal system, characterized by frivolous
lawsuits, neighborly disputes escalating into legal battles, and a

This text recounts the complex and ultimately dubious story of Yuri
Shutov, a former Leningrad deputy and businessman who became embroiled
in a series of increasingly serious accusations, including murder and
corruption, primarily during the 1990s in St. Petersburg. Shutov’s
career involved connections with prominent figures like Anatoly Sobchak
and Vladimir Putin, initially as a close associate and later as a target
of investigations fueled by accusations. The narrative details multiple
arrests, periods in prison, and ultimately, a highly controversial
release from court in 1999 following a staged and violent incident. The
text suggests that Shutov was deliberately framed and targeted, likely
due to his knowledge of potentially damaging information about Putin’s
early career within the KGB. The final events, including a brutal attack
on Shutov and his supporters, further support the idea that he was a
victim of a politically motivated conspiracy. The text concludes with
the assertion that Shutov remains a figure of concern, highlighting the
ongoing uncertainty surrounding his case and the possibility that he
continues to pose a threat.

This text argues that the United States’s conflict with Iran and radical
Islam is, in reality, a strategic opportunity for Russia. The author
contends that this conflict distracts the US from Russia, allowing
Russia to assert its influence and potentially fragment the former
Soviet bloc countries like Ukraine, Georgia, and Russia itself. The
author views the US’s double standards regarding nuclear proliferation –
accepting it in India, Pakistan, and Israel while opposing it in Iran –
as evidence of a power struggle. They believe that a successful Iranian
nuclear program would disrupt US control over oil supplies and
ultimately lead to a shift in global economic power, with Russia
regaining its historical position as a major player. The text frames
Iran’s actions as a defiant challenge to American hegemony and predicts
a future where Russia benefits from a world free from US dominance,
fueled by a potential Iranian nuclear weapon.

This text is a scathing critique of the financial situation of Russian
military personnel and the perceived mismanagement of defense spending
by the government. It argues that despite promises of increased
compensation and modernization, military salaries remain shockingly low
compared to other professions and, crucially, compared to the lavish
spending of senior government officials.

The author expresses frustration with the disparity between military pay
and the earnings of ministers and security service officers,
highlighting the perceived undervaluation of the armed forces. The piece
uses a rhetorical style, employing sarcasm and pointed comparisons to
underscore the author’s dissatisfaction. It criticizes the government’s
prioritization of spending on high-ranking officials and security
services over the needs of the military.

The text draws attention to the inadequacy of the military budget, the
slow pace of modernization, and the lack of transparency in defense
spending. It concludes with a call for greater accountability and a more
equitable distribution of resources within the defense sector. The
author references a broader discussion within the military’s own
publication, “Military Thought,” to bolster their argument and points

specifically referencing the Milosevic trial and the aftermath in the
Balkans. The author expresses frustration with the deliberate
downplaying of significant events, like the scale of mourners at

The piece critiques the creation of a “virtual, blissful reality”

    This text argues that Russia’s current state of disunity and decline
    stems from a lack of a unifying “Common Cause” – a shared national
    project that genuinely engages and inspires the populace. It posits
    that throughout Russian history, periods of strength have arisen
    from the emergence of a powerful “Whirlwind” – a chaotic,
    emotionally charged force that draws people together around a
    central, compelling idea. This “Whirlwind” then evolves into a
    “Project,” requiring a focused, collective effort to achieve a
    specific goal.

Currently, Russia is failing to generate this unifying “Common Cause.”
The author criticizes contemporary initiatives, such as “Four National
Projects” and staged celebrations, as superficial attempts to create
unity. They argue that the populace is passively accepting “gifts” from
the government (“like a beggar on a pallet”) and that large-scale
projects are driven by corporate interests rather than genuine national
needs.

The author proposes a revitalized “Common Cause” would involve

Valery Shambaro’s 2006 book, “Occult Roots of the October Revolution,”
explores the influence of occult forces, particularly through the figure
of Pyotr Venyaminov (known as Jakov Sverdlov), on the events surrounding
the Russian Revolution. The book argues that Sverdlov, acting as an
“emissary of unknown forces,” played a decisive role in shaping the
revolution’s trajectory, including orchestrating key decisions and
influencing figures like Lenin. Shambaro suggests Sverdlov’s actions
were remarkably effective until his untimely death in Oryol, where he
was struck by a “storm of stones.” The author contends that Sverdlov’s
influence extended beyond the revolution, potentially impacting the rise
of Stalin and the subsequent trajectory of Russia’s modern history,
including the roles of Gorbachev and Yeltsin. The book raises questions
about the deeper, potentially hidden, forces at play, suggesting
connections to figures like Schiff and other international financiers.

The article discusses the 26th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, a
major technological catastrophe in 1986. The explosion of the fourth
reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant caused widespread damage,
affecting over 500,000 people, resulting in over 4,000 deaths, and
contaminating 300,000 square kilometers. The event cost an estimated
$300 billion and involved the evacuation of approximately 350,000
people. The disaster highlighted the Soviet Union’s mobilization
capabilities and, according to the author, served as a “model for an
atomic war” in real-time. The article suggests that the response to
Chernobyl’s consequences mirrored the challenges of the Soviet Union’s
later “market reforms,” and emphasizes the importance of recognizing
this mobilization potential in today’s world facing numerous
catastrophic threats.

This text is a report from a 1996 international conference held in
Tehran, Iran, focused on supporting the Palestinian people. The
conference, attended by representatives from 88 Islamic states,
addressed several key issues. It strongly criticized the Israeli regime,
accusing it of occupation, human rights abuses, and maintaining an
extensive nuclear arsenal. The conference emphasized the importance of
Palestinian self-determination, advocating for democratic elections and
a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.

A central theme was the global support for the Palestinian people, with
a call for financial assistance and political backing. The conference
highlighted the Iranian government’s commitment to developing its
nuclear program for peaceful energy production and industrial
advancement, while acknowledging the potential for weaponization.

Furthermore, the conference addressed the issue of Palestinian refugees,
demanding guarantees for their right of return. It also condemned the
imprisonment of Palestinian leaders and the blockade of the Palestinian
government. A significant outcome was the signing of a unity memorandum
by ten Palestinian parties, including Fatah and Hamas. The conference
concluded with a strong condemnation of potential aggression against

<p>

This text is a cynical and skeptical analysis of the assault on Mikhail
Khodorkovsky in a Russian penal colony. The author, a former convict
(referred to as “zex”), believes the official narrative – that it was a
spontaneous, isolated incident – is a fabrication designed to discredit
Khodorkovsky. He argues that the attack was orchestrated, likely by
intelligence services, to psychologically and physically break
Khodorkovsky and undermine his chances of release.

The author highlights several key points: the potential involvement of
corrupt prison staff, the possibility of Khodorkovsky being a target due
to his wealth and connections, and the manipulation of the media to
frame the event. He expresses skepticism about the young prisoner,
Kuchma, suggesting he was acting under orders. The author also questions
the presence of weapons in the highly controlled environment of the
prison and points to a coordinated effort by online commentators to
create a narrative of Khodorkovsky being “lowered” with a facial scar.
Finally, he notes that Khodorkovsky’s decision not to pursue legal
action against the prisoner further fuels suspicion of a deliberate
cover-up and highlights the unequal treatment Khodorkovsky receives
compared to other inmates.

This lengthy text is a surreal and rambling narrative centered around a
recurring encounter with a rat in a dilapidated attic room. The
narrator, a journalist, describes a bizarre obsession with the rat,
attributing increasingly elaborate and paranoid interpretations to its
behavior. He explores themes of corruption, power, and societal decay,
using the rat as a symbol for various forms of human vice – greed,
manipulation, and nationalistic delusion.

The story unfolds through a stream-of-consciousness style, filled with
digressions, historical references (particularly Russian history and
figures like Pushkin and Isaev), and philosophical musings. The rat’s
actions are interpreted as reflecting the moral failings of individuals
and institutions, particularly within the context of Russian politics
and society. The narrator’s paranoia escalates, leading him to believe
the rat is a deliberate agent of chaos, perhaps even a divine
punishment.

Ultimately, the narrative suggests a critique of human nature and the
corrupting influence of power, using the rat as a bizarre and unsettling
metaphor for these forces. The story concludes with a sense of unease
and unanswered questions, leaving the reader to ponder the true nature
of the rat and its significance.

This text presents a bleak and cynical view of Russia’s political and
social landscape in the aftermath of 1993. It argues that a
revolutionary spirit is absent due to a combination of factors:
widespread apathy among the population, particularly among students and
the working class; the deliberate manipulation of social needs through
“social subversion” (providing Moscow with resources at the expense of
the provinces); and the suppression of dissent, exemplified by the 1993
uprising. The author contends that the government effectively prevents
unrest by keeping the population dependent and distracted with
superficial improvements in Moscow’s wealth, while simultaneously
exploiting the resentment of the provinces. The text suggests that the
population is too comfortable, too reliant on government handouts, and
too fearful to challenge the status quo, making a revolution impossible.
It concludes with a grim observation about the cost of this stability –

BRIGHT ESTHETICS OF VLADIMIR BONDARENKO

</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy review and critique of Vladimir Bondarenko’s
book, “Live Dangerously,” published in 2006. The reviewer, writing in a
somewhat polemical and nostalgic tone, argues that Bondarenko’s work is
a significant and provocative contribution to Russian literature,
particularly in its embrace of modernist aesthetics and its unapologetic
engagement with forbidden themes.

The reviewer frames Bondarenko’s work as a necessary corrective to a
perceived lack of intellectual rigor and spiritual depth within
contemporary Russian literary criticism. He emphasizes Bondarenko’s
willingness to confront uncomfortable truths and challenge prevailing
orthodoxies, comparing him favorably to earlier, more influential
Russian literary critics like Belinsky, Gregoire, and Stroev.

A central theme is Bondarenko’s perceived audacity and willingness to
“trespass” onto territory considered taboo by many of his peers,
particularly those influenced by Western literary trends. The reviewer
sees this as a courageous act of intellectual independence.

Furthermore, the text highlights a deep concern about the state of
Russian literary culture, lamenting a perceived decline in critical
engagement and spiritual awareness. The reviewer expresses a desire to
see Russian literature return to its roots, drawing inspiration from the
traditions of the Second Rome (Constantinople/Moscow) and the Orthodox
Christian worldview.

The review concludes with a warning about the potential consequences of
failing to embrace such challenging and unconventional perspectives,
suggesting that a lack of intellectual boldness could lead to stagnation
and a loss of cultural identity. It’s a passionate defense of
Bondarenko’s work and a broader critique of the perceived limitations of
contemporary Russian literary thought.

This text is a scathing critique of Russian Defence Minister Sergei
Ivanov’s actions and policies, particularly his relationship with NATO.
It argues that Ivanov has consistently prioritized appeasing the United
States and NATO, undermining Russia’s national interests and strategic
position. The core argument is that Ivanov’s actions – including
supporting NATO expansion, facilitating meetings with American
officials, and accepting the closure of the Lourdes intelligence center
– demonstrate a profound lack of understanding of Russia’s geopolitical
challenges and a willingness to surrender key strategic advantages.

The author uses a series of pointed examples, including the Lourdes
intelligence center, the Камрань naval base, and the “Russia-NATO:
United Efforts – 2006” campaign, to illustrate Ivanov’s perceived
subservience to the West. The text draws parallels with past Russian
officials who were similarly perceived as weak and ineffective in
dealing with the United States, specifically referencing figures like
Yevgeny Primakov and Andrei Kozyrev.

Ultimately, the text expresses deep skepticism about Ivanov’s leadership
and suggests that his actions have been detrimental to Russia’s security
and strategic standing. It concludes with a pessimistic outlook,
highlighting the loss of key Russian intelligence assets and the
continued influence of the United States in Russia’s foreign policy.

This text details the ongoing and problematic legal case against
Sergeant Sergei Arkhachev and Lieutenant Evgeny Khudyakov, accused of
involvement in the deaths of Chechen civilians following a conflict in
the Chechen Republic. The case has been plagued by inconsistencies,
delayed investigations, and questionable evidence. Initially, the men
were twice acquitted by a jury, but the prosecution is now pursuing the
case through a military court.

The core issues highlighted are the lack of a military defense attorney,
the pressure exerted by the military prosecutor’s office, and the
potential for biased investigations driven by a desire to “close the
case.” The investigation has been hampered by a lack of forensic
evidence and a reluctance to conduct exhumations, citing cultural
sensitivities. Witnesses have been unreliable, and the legal process has
been marked by a lack of transparency and fairness.

The article emphasizes the broader context of similar cases involving
military personnel and civilian casualties, suggesting a pattern of
injustice and a lack of accountability. The authors express concern
about the potential for “legal farsa” and the need for a more just and
transparent legal system to address these issues. The case of Arkhachev

interview focuses on the party’s future, the challenges facing the
Russian patriotic movement, and Rogozin’s personal outlook.

Rogozin discusses the reasons for his departure from “Rodina,”
attributing it to the intense pressure and divisions within the

party and the broader patriotic movement, highlighting the historical
patterns of fragmentation within Russian patriotic organizations. He

Rogozin outlines a strategy for the party’s future, including a focus on
developing relationships with international conservative and nationalist
forces, while maintaining a critical distance from international
organizations. He advocates for a strong role for the Russian Orthodox
Church within the patriotic movement and proposes a legal framework to

He expresses concern about the current political climate in Russia and

This text analyzes the political situation in Ukraine following the 2004
“Orange Revolution,” focusing on the complex interplay of American and
Russian influence. It argues that the United States, driven by a “soft
hegemony” model prioritizing information and financial control, views
Ukraine as a strategically vital asset – a “geopolitical hamster” to be
used against Russia. The text contends that the US seeks to limit
Russia’s influence by leveraging Ukraine’s weak economy and political
instability.

Specifically, it criticizes the “Orange” coalition led by Viktor
Yushchenko and Julia Tymoshenko, deeming Tymoshenko’s populist policies
and close ties to Russian energy interests unacceptable to American
interests. The author suggests that the US views the situation as a
choice between removing Tymoshenko or triggering a collapse of the
“Orange” coalition, ultimately leading to a new political landscape.

The analysis highlights the perceived conflict between American and
Russian geopolitical goals in Ukraine, portraying the country as a
battleground for influence. It concludes with a pessimistic outlook,

This text is a lengthy, cynical analysis of a recent interview given by
Anatoly Chubais, a prominent figure in Russian politics, particularly
during the 1990s. The core argument is that Chubais’s reappearance in
the public sphere is not a genuine attempt to reform Russia, but rather
a calculated move by the US to regain influence within Russia,
specifically targeting the relationship between Russian oligarchs and
the US Democratic Party.

The text contends that Chubais is attempting to revive a pre-existing
alliance between Russian energy interests (represented by figures like
Viktor Chernomyrdin) and Western liberal financiers, aiming to undermine
the current Kremlin leadership, which is heavily reliant on this same
relationship. Chubais’s interview is presented as a deliberate attempt
to create a “resistance movement” against the current government,
mirroring events from 1996 when he was involved in removing “siloviki”
(security forces) from positions of power.

The author suggests that Chubais’s actions are driven by a long-term
strategy to re-establish US influence in Russia, anticipating a shift in
power dynamics leading up to the 2008 presidential elections. The text
highlights Chubais’s attempts to manipulate public perception by
revisiting past events and emphasizing the role of figures like
Chernomyrdin, while simultaneously positioning himself as a leader of

</p>
<p>

This text presents a complex and layered argument about Russia’s role in
the world, framing it as a historically-rooted “other” – a reserve for
humanity, intended to avert a looming global catastrophe. It posits a
series of “Empires” within Russia’s history – from the Byzantine to the
Stalinist – each characterized by a distinct, often counter-Western,
spiritual and ideological orientation. These empires were deliberately
shaped to resist the perceived decline of the West, embodying a
“different” path towards salvation, often involving a mystical or
quasi-religious approach to technological and scientific advancement.

The core argument is that Russia’s unique historical trajectory, marked
by suffering and spiritual depth, positions it to lead humanity into a
“Fifth Empire,” characterized by ambitious biotechnological endeavors –
particularly “life-creation” – guided by a fundamentally different ethos
than the West’s. This “Russian globalism” is driven by a desire to
overcome entropy and death, utilizing a “magical” approach to genetic
engineering, potentially creating a new, subservient human form, or
alternatively, guided by love and a desire for resurrection.

Ultimately, the text suggests Russia’s perceived “otherness” and its
historical role as a “reserve” explain its numerous spiritual and
ideological adversaries, and that this “otherness” is a crucial element
of a future global order.

predicts a catastrophic global economic collapse triggered by a
potential US-Iran conflict, leading to a shift in global power dynamics
with Russia emerging as a dominant force. Russia’s rise is predicated on
controlling vital resources, particularly water, and exploiting vast,

This text is a highly critical and apocalyptic vision of contemporary
Russia, framed as a decaying, fragmented empire attempting to reassert
itself. It argues that Russia’s current state – “obliterated” and
“broken” – is a consequence of past imperial ambitions and a failure to
adapt. The author predicts a future where Russia will violently reassert
control over surrounding territories, utilizing manipulative tactics
like “orange revolutions” and economic pressure. It portrays Russia as a
dangerous, chaotic force, driven by a nostalgic and ultimately
destructive imperial impulse. The text uses vivid, almost mythical
imagery – “whirlwinds,” “crystal mazes,” “sacred vessels” – to depict
Russia’s history and future, suggesting a cyclical pattern of expansion,
fragmentation, and violent resurgence. Ultimately, it envisions a
restored Russia as a powerful, religiously-infused empire, dominating
Eurasia and serving as a “sacred offering.”

This text critiques the Russian media’s portrayal of health and
wellness, arguing it’s largely superficial and misleading. It highlights
a trend of focusing on cosmetic concerns and quick fixes, exemplified by
shows like “Formula of Beauty” and “Emergency” (both adaptations of
Western formats), alongside the promotion of dubious health advice and
celebrity endorsements. The author argues that this distracts from
genuine healthcare needs and contributes to a culture of seeking
immediate, often ineffective, solutions rather than addressing
underlying health issues. The lavish coverage of medical awards and the
obsession with “correcting” physical imperfections are seen as
symptomatic of a broader societal problem – a misplaced emphasis on
appearance over actual health and a reliance on sensationalized, often
dangerous, self-treatment methods. The author concludes that this trend
leads to preventable deaths and a distorted understanding of what
constitutes real healthcare.

This text is a strongly worded, indignant critique of the Russian
ombudsman, Vladimir Lukin, and the broader liberal movement in Russia.
The author expresses deep distrust of Lukin’s motives, accusing him of
prioritizing the interests of ideological disruptors over the rights and
feelings of ordinary Russians, particularly religious believers. The
author uses historical comparisons – referencing figures like Щаранский

compromised activism and deals with powerful entities. The core argument
is that Lukin’s actions are driven by a desire to undermine traditional
Russian values and patriotism, rather than genuinely protecting human

This text is a satirical commentary on the tendency in Russia to rewrite

This lengthy text, likely a philosophical essay, explores the
interpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche through the lens of Martin
Heidegger, focusing on the concept of “nothingness” or nihilism. It
argues that Western philosophical traditions, particularly German
idealism and positivism, have led to a fragmented and ultimately
meaningless self-understanding. Heidegger critiques the tendency to
impose categories and values onto experience, advocating for a more
direct engagement with the “nothingness” inherent in existence.

The text employs a provocative and somewhat absurd imagery – the image
of a Russian peasant wielding a saber, declaring “nothing,” to
illustrate the power of this radical negation. It suggests that Western
thought, driven by a desire for order and explanation, has ironically
created a space of profound emptiness. The author emphasizes Heidegger’s
mathematical approach and his deliberate use of quotation marks to
highlight the artificiality of concepts like “German humanism.”
Ultimately, the essay posits that true understanding comes not from
imposing meaning, but from confronting the unsettling reality of
“nothingness.”

This text is a critical review of recent translations and publications
of Chinese literature in Russia, primarily focusing on the works of Gao
Xingjian, Wei Hoy, and Cai Jun. The author expresses disappointment with
the limited availability and quality of contemporary Chinese literature
in Russia, arguing that translations are often rushed and superficial,
frequently relying on translations from English.

He highlights the case of Gao Xingjian, a Nobel laureate whose work is
largely ignored despite his recognition abroad. The author criticizes
the lack of engagement with Chinese literature by Russian literary
critics and publishers, suggesting a preference for commercially viable,
Western-influenced works.

Despite this criticism, the author does express some positive
observations, particularly regarding the work of Cai Jun, praising his
blend of traditional Chinese folklore with modern narrative techniques.
He notes the influence of Russian culture in Cai Jun’s writing and
suggests comparisons to Russian authors like Sergei Alexeev and Mikhail
Popov.

Ultimately, the piece conveys a sense of frustration with the limited
access to and understanding of contemporary Chinese literature within
the Russian publishing landscape, questioning the priorities of Russian

This text is a lengthy, critical review of three theatrical productions
– “As I Lay Dying” by William Faulkner, “The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn” by Mark Twain, and a production of “War and Peace” by the Brothers
P. and S. Presnyakovs – staged by the Oleg Tabakov Theatre-Studio
(“Tabakerka”). The reviewer, writing in 2006, expresses considerable
dissatisfaction with the productions, arguing they are largely
superficial, satirical, and lacking in genuine understanding or
appreciation of the source material.

He criticizes the “Tabakerka” productions for prioritizing ironic
detachment and playful mockery over substantive engagement with the
works of Faulkner, Twain, and Tolstoy. He finds the staging of “As I Lay
Dying” particularly problematic, highlighting the actors’ tendency
towards caricature and the overall lack of emotional depth. The
production of “War and Peace” is dismissed as a “kitchey” spectacle,
failing to convey the core themes of the novel.

The reviewer emphasizes the importance of genuine artistic passion and a

the perceived superficiality of the “Tabakerka” productions. He
concludes with a reflection on the enduring value of the source material

“ЯйцЫ Фаберже” is an Orlovsk-based band formed in 2003, known for their
eclectic sound blending ska, punk, folk, and other influences. Their
debut album, “Вкрутую,” gained popularity, particularly in Moscow, due
to its energetic performance and high-quality musicianship. The second
album, while still energetic, shifted towards a more accessible and less
overtly political tone, focusing on the everyday struggles of provincial
youth. The band’s lyrics, primarily written by frontman Nils and
featuring contributions from Konstantin Stupin, often tackle social
issues and are rooted in the experiences of working-class individuals.
Despite a perceived decrease in ideological sharpness compared to their
first album, the band remains committed to addressing social injustices
and expresses support for football, particularly for “Spartak” and the
Russian national team. The band’s success is attributed to their unique
sound, energetic performances, and honest portrayal of contemporary
life. They are celebrating their 3-year anniversary with a concert on

This text is a lengthy analysis of Vladimir Putin and the Russian
political situation, primarily as presented in an article by Mikhail
Kugushev. The core argument is that Putin’s leadership is shaped by a
deep, long-term “systemic crisis” within Russia, dating back to the
mid-1970s.

The author contends that Putin’s strategies – including prioritizing
external relations, building a loyal team, and managing the country’s
finances – are all responses to this crisis. He critiques the notion
that Putin is a brilliant strategist, arguing instead that he’s a
“lucky” figure who has capitalized on a situation created by decades of
systemic problems.

Key points include: Western anxieties about Russia are rooted in a
specific, identifiable “subject” rather than simply geopolitical
tensions; Putin’s focus on external relations is driven by the nature of
the crisis; the Russian public’s support for Putin stems from a
“mezzoburgeois” mentality seeking a unifying leader; and the challenges
facing Russia – demographic decline, corruption, infrastructure issues –
are too deeply entrenched to be resolved quickly.

The author predicts a period of escalating crisis over the next few
years, requiring significant societal mobilization and potentially
radical changes in governance. He draws parallels to historical figures
like Napoleon and Roosevelt, emphasizing the importance of decisive
action in the face of systemic challenges. Ultimately, the text suggests
that while Putin will remain a key figure, the success of his leadership
hinges on the ability of Russian society to confront and overcome the
deeply rooted systemic crisis.

This text, a 2006 opinion piece published in the Russian webzine

author, a longtime associate of Alexander Baygushev, argues that the
situation is complex and potentially worsening. He criticizes the

The author highlights several specific examples, including the rise of

to the condemnation of Soviet Jewish commissars by Jewish emigrants in

Furthermore, the author expresses frustration with the lack of

</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, polemical argument, primarily written in 2006,
expressing deep suspicion and hostility towards Jewish influence,
particularly within Russian society and religious thought. The author,
Mikhail Nazorov (M.N.), argues that Jewish figures and interpretations
of religious texts (specifically, the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh and the New
Testament) are actively manipulating events and promoting a hidden
agenda of dominance.

The core of the argument revolves around the idea of a “messianic”
figure – initially interpreted as a “Messiah” (Christ) but later recast
as a deceptive “antichrist” figure, particularly through the lens of the
“sons of Shem” (a biblical reference). The author contends that Jewish
figures like Alexander Baygushev are promoting a distorted understanding
of history, particularly regarding the roles of Jewish and Russian
peoples, and are actively seeking to establish a future dominated by
Jewish interests.

The text utilizes numerous specific examples, including quotes from
Jewish religious texts (like the “Shulhan Arukh” code), interpretations
of biblical prophecies (particularly the “sons of Shem” prophecy), and
the writings of Jewish figures (Radzhevsky, Berl Lazar, Slezkin, and
others). It expresses concern over alleged Jewish manipulation within
the Israeli-Lebanon conflict and highlights alleged instances of Jewish
children wishing death upon non-Jewish peers.

Ultimately, the author expresses skepticism towards any attempts at
genuine dialogue, arguing that Jewish figures are only willing to engage
on their own terms, promoting a distorted “pink Judeo-Christianity” that
demands conformity and the suppression of Orthodox religious
understanding. The text concludes with a pessimistic view of the future,
suggesting that Jewish influence will continue to shape events, with
Jewish people ultimately determining who survives.

</p>

This text analyzes Russia’s systemic crises, tracing them through three
distinct phases. The first (1973-2000) stemmed from corruption, economic
stagnation, and a failure to adapt to changing global dynamics, fueled
by Soviet bureaucracy and a lack of a clear ideological direction. The
second phase (1991-2000) saw the further dismantling of the Soviet
system through privatization, the rise of oligarchs, and a shift towards
a Western-influenced consumer culture, accompanied by a growing conflict
with the West. The third phase (2000 onwards) reflects an attempt by
Putin’s government to address the crisis through a combination of state
intervention, resource exploitation, and strategic maneuvering, while
simultaneously attempting to manage the ongoing tensions with the West.
The author argues that Russia’s systemic crises are fundamentally linked
to the absence of a clear “sverkhideal” – a supreme ideal or guiding
vision – and that without such a vision, Russia remains trapped in a
cycle of crisis and attempted solutions, with the West viewing Russia
primarily as a resource provider. The text concludes that Russia’s
future depends on formulating a new, overarching strategic direction.

lives and reincarnation. The author argues that this belief is often
rooted in psychological vulnerabilities and can be exploited,
particularly by those in power. They see it as a dangerous trend, fueled
by media promotion and supported by figures who offer simplistic
explanations for complex human behavior. The author contends that this
belief encourages a sense of justification for negative actions,
allowing individuals to rationalize their shortcomings by claiming past
lives as animals or historical figures. They believe it’s a form of
psychological manipulation, particularly useful for those seeking to
excuse immoral behavior. Ultimately, the author advocates for a focus on
living a genuinely human life, rather than seeking refuge in fantastical
narratives about previous existences.

The article argues that Western perceptions of Islam are often rooted in
historical biases, particularly the legacy of the Crusades and
subsequent cultural imperialism. It contends that Westerners frequently
apply double standards to Muslims, condemning actions that are accepted
in their own societies. The text suggests that a persistent belief in
Western superiority, fueled by the two World Wars and the atomic
bombings, contributes to a fear of Islam’s resurgence as a viable
alternative model for the 21st century. It criticizes the tendency to
marginalize religion in favor of materialism and views Muslims as
“backward” due to their adherence to faith, despite the increasing
number of educated Muslims embracing Islam.

GREAT PATRIOTISM THROUGH THE EYES OF THE TRINITY SERVICE PERSONNEL
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2006-09-26 - <b> Vladimir Bushin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, rambling, and highly biased polemic presented as
a fictional dialogue and report. It’s a satirical piece filled with
historical inaccuracies, exaggerations, and personal attacks, primarily
targeting perceived enemies of a nostalgic, idealized view of Russian
history and, specifically, the Soviet era.

The core of the piece is a critique of those who commemorate Lenin and
Stalin, portraying them as misguided and ultimately harmful. It uses a
fabricated “report” format, incorporating fictional interviews, letters,
and opinions to build a case against these commemorations.

Key elements include:

-   **Historical distortions:** The text misrepresents historical
    events, such as the return of the Guard regiments, the creation of
    films like “Alexander Nevsky,” and the circumstances surrounding the
    placement of monuments.
-   **Personal attacks:** It employs insults and derogatory language
    towards individuals and groups it deems to be “truth-tellers” or
    “khooluy” (lackeys).
-   **Nostalgic Idealization:** The text expresses a strong, idealized
    nostalgia for a Russia dominated by Tsarist figures like Nicholas II
    and Kolchak, portraying them as heroic defenders of the nation.
-   **Anti-Communist Rhetoric:** It utilizes heavily negative
    stereotypes about communism and its proponents, accusing them of
    destroying Russian culture and values.
-   **Satirical Tone:** The entire piece is presented in a highly
    exaggerated and satirical manner, employing absurd scenarios and
    hyperbolic language to make its point.

Essentially, the text is a deliberately provocative and largely
fabricated argument against the commemoration of Lenin and Stalin,
framed as a report from a group of “truth-tellers” confronting those who
uphold a distorted historical narrative.

2006-09-26 - <b> Yuriy Nersesov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a commentary on the 2006 referendum in Transnistria, framed
as a complex geopolitical situation with multiple Russian influences and
external actors involved. The referendum, which overwhelmingly supported
joining Russia, was viewed as a result of a deliberate strategy by the
Transnistrian leadership to leverage Russian support.

The article highlights the involvement of various actors: the Moldovan
government, which refused to recognize the referendum’s legitimacy;
Western powers, particularly the EU, who also rejected the results; and
three distinct “Russias” – one providing direct military and financial
support, another offering a more cautious, supportive stance, and a
third represented by disruptive elements.

It emphasizes the strategic importance of the referendum, portraying it
as a calculated move to secure Russian allegiance and potentially create
a buffer zone between Russia and the EU. The author critiques the
inconsistent actions of Western powers and the presence of disruptive
elements within the Transnistrian community. The text concludes by
suggesting that Transnistria operates within a three-pronged Russian
influence, requiring careful management to maintain stability.

2006-09-26 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a critical analysis of the 2007 Russian state budget,
presented as a roundtable discussion. The speakers – Dmitry Львоv,
Nikolai Petrakov, Mikhail Delyagin, and Alexander Nagorniy –
overwhelmingly condemn the budget as fundamentally flawed and
detrimental to Russia’s economic development.

Key criticisms include: the budget is based on a false, overly
optimistic economic forecast, it’s driven by a desire to maintain a
dollar-dependent economy, it prioritizes suppressing inflation at the
expense of domestic development and human well-being, and it’s riddled
with corruption and a lack of transparency. Specifically, the massive
accumulation of funds in the Stabilization Fund and gold reserves is
seen as a deliberate strategy to finance the US economy and maintain a
weak ruble. The speakers argue that the budget is a “war budget” against
the Russian people, characterized by a focus on controlling inflation
rather than fostering genuine economic growth and development. They
highlight the lack of investment in domestic industries, the outflow of
capital, and the detrimental impact on the population. The discussion
concludes with a strong call for greater transparency and a fundamental
shift in economic policy.

This text explores the evolving nature of political power and influence
surrounding Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. It posits a shift from
traditional political strategies to “magical technologies” – utilizing
psychological manipulation and “psy-weapons” to influence Putin’s
decisions. The text outlines four key centers of power – “siloviki”
(security forces), “technocrats” (linked to the military-industrial
complex), “neoliberals,” and “oligarchs” – and their competing efforts
to sway Putin’s decision regarding a third presidential term. The core
argument is that these groups are employing sophisticated psychological
warfare, potentially involving “psy-bombs,” to control the Kremlin’s
trajectory. The text frames this as a struggle for Russia’s future, with
one side seeking development and the other advocating for American
dominance, and suggests a potential “battle for Putin” will ultimately
determine Russia’s fate. It draws parallels to historical “imperial
technologies” and utilizes imagery of magic, bulls, and religious
protection to illustrate the complex and increasingly unconventional
methods being used to exert control.

EMPIRE OF SPIRIT AS A VECTOR OF DEVELOPMENT
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2006-10-17 - <b> A. Ivanov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, polemical essay arguing for Russia’s future as a
“Grand Empire,” particularly in the context of a shift towards a
“culturally-spiritual” global stage. The author frames Russia’s current
situation as a “sick patient” recovering from the devastation of the
1990s, viewing the country’s trajectory as a necessary transition
towards a new, dominant role in the world.

The core argument is that Russia *must* embrace imperial ambitions to
survive and thrive in the 21st century. This isn’t a nostalgic return to
past empires, but a strategic necessity dictated by the evolving global
landscape. The author contends that Russia is uniquely positioned to
lead in a future where cultural and spiritual influence will be
paramount, rather than solely technological advancement.

Key points include:

-   **Recovery and Strategic Vision:** Russia is emerging from a period
    of crisis and needs a clear, long-term strategy, centered on
    imperial resurgence.
-   **Shifting Global Priorities:** The world is moving beyond the
    “information-technology” era towards one dominated by culture and
    spirituality, and Russia is best suited to lead this transition.
-   **Imperial Tools:** The author advocates for utilizing education,
    science, and information technology to build the foundations of a
    new empire.
-   **Defensive Measures:** The author sees attempts to undermine
    Russia’s cultural and religious traditions as deliberate attempts to
    weaken the empire.
-   **Elite Formation:** The formation of a professional and responsible
    elite is crucial to Russia’s success.

The essay is characterized by a strong sense of urgency, a critical view
of Western influence, and a belief in Russia’s historical destiny. It
suggests that Russia’s future depends on consciously shaping its role in
the world, prioritizing cultural and spiritual leadership over purely
economic or military power.

It argues that the prize was politically motivated, influenced by the

This text reviews Konstantin Krylov’s book, “No Time,” a collection of
essays and reviews. Krylov, a Russian nationalist and conservative
intellectual, offers a scathing critique of contemporary culture,
including literature, art, and even historical figures. The book’s
central argument revolves around the perceived “lack of time” for
genuine intellectual engagement, arguing that modern life prioritizes
superficial pursuits over deep reflection. Krylov’s style is
characterized by sharp, often provocative, opinions and a distrust of
many contemporary thinkers and trends, including those associated with
postmodernism and German culture. He expresses a disdain for figures
like Derrida, Pellevin, and even some Russian classics, viewing them as
lacking substance. The book’s title reflects Krylov’s belief that the
pressures of modern life leave little time for thoughtful reading and
analysis. He frames this “lack of time” as a deliberate manipulation,
suggesting a sinister force is actively controlling people’s time. The
review concludes with a reference to a biblical passage, emphasizing the

He laments the loss of radio stations, the closure of Russian-language

The article details the formation of the “Congress of Russian
Communities” (KRO), spearheaded by Dmitry Rogozin, following a recent
conference. Rogozin aims to create a hybrid organization combining
elements of “Rodina” and the “Russian National Unity” (DPIU) movements,
attempting to leverage the strengths of both while avoiding past
failures.

The KRO’s core strategy involves fostering a decentralized, grassroots
movement focused on uniting Russians regardless of their social
standing, with a particular emphasis on fostering connections within
Russia and with Russian communities abroad. Key elements include
establishing a “Russian Trade Union” and “Russian Human Rights
Organization,” advocating for Russian rights, engaging in
anti-discrimination campaigns, and potentially creating a “Russian
Class” based on local support.

Rogozin envisions the KRO as a network, not a traditional party, with
ambitions to include alternative media outlets, an “Internet
Television,” and even a “Russian University.” He also intends to foster
connections with diaspora communities, particularly those of indigenous
peoples of Russia, to counter existing structures.

Crucially, Rogozin emphasizes the importance of a willingness to take
decisive action, referencing the past failures of “Rodina” due to a lack
of concrete action. He believes that a willingness to engage in
political concessions, such as hunger strikes, is essential for the
KRO’s survival.

Finally, the article suggests that the Kremlin views the KRO as a
competitive force, acknowledging its potential influence but also
expressing concerns about its ability to mobilize and act decisively.
