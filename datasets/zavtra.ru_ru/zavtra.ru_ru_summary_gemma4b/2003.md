2003-01-14 - <b> Anna Serafimova </b>
</p>
<p>
The text is a satirical critique of the lives and attitudes of wealthy
Russians in the early 2000s. It describes a disconnect between the
opulent lifestyles of the newly rich and the exploitative treatment of
domestic workers. The author highlights the superficiality of magazines
catering to the “non-5%,” the mercenary nature of domestic help, and the
callous disregard for the well-being of those employed by the wealthy.
The narrative uses anecdotes—a former engineer turned governess, a
pharmaceutical family’s exploitative practices—to illustrate a system
where workers are treated as disposable, valued only for their utility
and subject to constant surveillance and control. The overall tone is
cynical and critical, portraying a society where wealth is accompanied
by a lack of empathy and a focus on self-interest.

2003-01-14 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a scathing critique of a US-funded agricultural
“reorganization” project in Russia, highlighting a deeply flawed and
wasteful system. The author argues that American money was primarily
used to pay a series of unqualified “consultants,” primarily a Texan
named John, who traveled around Russia giving ineffective advice based
on superficial knowledge and American-produced materials. These
consultants were paid exorbitant salaries (around $30,000 - $50,000 per
month) for minimal impact, measured solely by the number of trips and
presentations they made. The author expresses concern that these
consultants were likely members of a cult, and that American children
visiting families in the US were being exposed to potentially harmful
religious influences. The core argument is that the funds were
mismanaged and wasted, representing a significant drain on Russian
resources without achieving any tangible agricultural improvements.

In the town of Shchelkovo, Viktor Podsolnukhov, a 55-year-old factory
worker, died of a heart attack. His death was attributed to the lack of
a telephone, which could have alerted emergency services. After feeling
unwell around Christmas, he experienced chest pains and fear of death.
His daughter, Alina, attempted to call for help, but neighbors who had
recently acquired Western-style magnetic and plastic cards refused to
assist. A librarian, a retired neighbor, and a sociology professor also
failed to provide assistance. Despite multiple attempts, Alina was
unable to reach emergency services, and Viktor Podsolnukhov died before
help arrived. The story highlights the disparity between new housing
developments and the needs of long-term residents, and the failure of
promises of telephone access in the area.

2003-01-14 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the controversy surrounding the
proposed “Fundamentals of Orthodox Culture” curriculum in Russian
schools. It argues that the opposition to the curriculum was a
politically motivated attack, orchestrated by figures like Mikhail
Kasianov and driven by a desire to undermine Russia’s national identity
rooted in Orthodox values. The author contends that the backlash was
fueled by a broader ideological agenda – materialism, secularism, and
anti-religious sentiment – promoted by Western-aligned elites.

The piece accuses prominent figures of corruption, suggesting that the
1998 financial crisis was a result of mismanagement and embezzlement by
those in power. It criticizes the glorification of “toughness” and
criminality in media and popular culture, contrasting it with the values
traditionally promoted by the Orthodox Church. Ultimately, the author
views the opposition to the “Fundamentals” as a deliberate attempt to
erase Russia’s historical and spiritual foundations, driven by a foreign
agenda seeking to destabilize the country.

<p>
2003-01-14 - <b> Georgiy Sudovtsev </b>
</p>
<p>
The text describes a bleak situation in Russia at the beginning of 2003,
primarily focusing on the town of Valdai and broader issues of
infrastructure failures and governmental response. Severe cold weather
led to widespread heating outages, impacting thousands of residents and
highlighting systemic problems within the country’s housing and energy
sectors. The failures were attributed to ineffective “reforms” and a
lack of investment, with critics blaming the government’s policies.
Despite the crisis, the government prioritized a presidential ski trip,
and a joint commission was formed to address the situation, though
skepticism remains about its effectiveness. The text suggests a
disconnect between the government’s actions and the severity of the
problems, and a broader critique of the country’s economic and political
direction, using the metaphor of “дарвалдая” (a reference to a Valdai
folk tale) to represent a perceived lack of critical thinking.

<p>

This text is a scathing critique of how Russian television has portrayed
the life and legacy of Vladimir Vysotsky. The author argues that instead
of exploring Vysotsky’s profound insights into the decline of Russian
society and his artistic brilliance, television has focused on
sensationalized details of his personal life, scandals, and superficial
“celebrations” of his 65th anniversary.

The author criticizes numerous television programs, including those
featuring Nikita Vysotsky, Yuri Lubimov, and even Vladimir Putin, for
prioritizing a shallow, politically motivated portrayal over a genuine
understanding of Vysotsky’s work and its critical relevance. The author
sees this as a deliberate attempt to manipulate public opinion and
distract from the deeper issues facing the country.

The piece highlights the hypocrisy of the situation, where a poet who
foresaw a nation’s collapse is now being celebrated through a series of
staged events and superficial tributes. The author expresses skepticism
about the motives behind the awards and recognition, suggesting they are
driven by political expediency rather than artistic appreciation.
Ultimately, the text portrays a disheartening scenario of a cultural
icon being reduced to a spectacle of manufactured nostalgia and
political maneuvering.

“В-52” ABOVE MOSCOW

</a>
<p>
2003-01-28 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, produced by a North American analytical center (NAMACON) in
2002, presents a detailed assessment of the potential for a U.S.
military intervention in Russia. It argues that the United States is
actively exploring this possibility, driven by Russia’s declining status
as a major power, its internal instability, and the potential for a
“force majeure” situation – such as a politically motivated upheaval –
to justify intervention.

The analysis highlights several key concerns: Russia’s deteriorating
economic and social conditions, its internal political fragmentation,
and the potential for conflict fueled by ethnic tensions. It suggests
that the U.S. is closely monitoring Russia’s military capabilities and
considering scenarios involving intervention, potentially with the
support of neighboring countries.

The document emphasizes that Russia’s decline creates opportunities for
U.S. involvement, citing a series of potential triggers, including a
destabilized political environment, a resurgence of nationalist
sentiment, or a humanitarian crisis. It details a strategic assessment
of Russia’s military and economic weaknesses, and the potential for U.S.
involvement in supporting or directly intervening in conflicts within
Russia or its surrounding regions. The analysis concludes with a stark
assessment of the strategic implications of Russia’s decline for the
United States, framing Russia as a potential threat requiring continued
vigilance and strategic planning.

<p>
The text is a 2002 Russian-language essay expressing deep concern and
criticism regarding economic and social changes in Russia, particularly
the perceived dominance of non-Russian populations and the role of the
Orthodox Church. The author argues that the vast majority of Russian
property has been acquired by “national minorities,” accompanied by a
silent “gold silence” from religious and political leaders. He
criticizes the Orthodox Church for prioritizing profit over its role as
a protector of Russian culture and identity, referencing historical
figures who actively opposed perceived threats to Russia. The author
applauds the outspokenness of Ilya Glazunov, who challenged the
prevailing silence, and expresses skepticism towards figures like Berel
Lazar, a prominent Hasidic rabbi. The core argument is a lament for the
loss of traditional Russian values and a warning against the perceived
betrayal of national interests by key institutions.

</p>
<p>
Television’s inherent nature is characterized by internal conflicts and
rebellions since the industry’s inception. Throughout the 80s and 90s,
particularly with leadership changes, tensions existed among editors,
directors, and presenters – dissidents, politically engaged individuals,
and those highly compensated. A recent NTV conflict involved top
journalists resisting the appointment of Senkevich, the son of a famous
presenter. Journalists like Mitkov and Shuster demanded leadership
positions, but were dismissed. Figures like Parfenov initially protested
then quickly embraced the new direction. The era of Gusinsky, marked by
violence and lavish spending, also ended with a significant conflict.
Following the removal of Gusinsky, Jordan’s arrival was met with
resistance, and finally, Senkevich suppressed the last major conflict.
Putin subsequently voiced opposition to commercialization of television,
reflecting a shift in his approach.

This text is a semi-autobiographical essay by Valentin Rasputin,
reflecting on a winter storm and his experiences at a Siberian
sanatorium. He describes a particularly intense blizzard, comparing it
to an apocalyptic event and reflecting on the fragility of life and the
inevitability of change. Rasputin recounts his stay at the sanatorium,
focusing on the unsettling weather and the strange, almost surreal
atmosphere. He details the physical effects of the storm – the howling
wind, the falling snow, and the disruption of daily life. He uses the
storm as a backdrop to explore themes of mortality, the relationship
between humanity and nature, and the search for meaning in a chaotic
world. The essay is characterized by Rasputin’s distinctive style,
blending philosophical reflections with vivid sensory details and a
slightly melancholic tone. He uses the storm as a metaphor for the
anxieties and uncertainties of modern life, and ultimately finds solace
in the simple act of observing and appreciating the beauty of the
natural world.

This text is a transcript of a conversation between Vladimir Bondarenko
and Yelena Soyina, a poet, discussing the role and relevance of poetry
in the modern world. They explore Soyina’s creative process, her
relationship to her work, and the responsibility of the poet to their
audience.

The core of the discussion centers around the perceived decline in
readership and sales of poetry, with Bondarenko questioning the current
relevance of the art form. Soyina counters this by asserting that poetry
remains vital, particularly for offering solace and reflection to
readers seeking emotional connection. She emphasizes the importance of
sincerity in poetry and highlights the poet’s role in anticipating and
potentially influencing events, both large and personal.

Ultimately, the conversation argues that while the landscape of poetry
has changed, the need for poets and their work remains constant, driven
by the fundamental human desire for meaning and connection.

<p>

This text critiques the pervasive corruption and bureaucratic
inefficiencies within Russia’s government and economy. It argues that
the expansion of the state apparatus, stemming from the Soviet era and
continuing into the post-Soviet period, has created a system where
officials exploit their power for personal gain. The author traces this
issue back to the shift from a party-dominated system to a more
expansive state bureaucracy, highlighting how the lack of accountability
and the continued influence of the Communist Party fostered a culture of
corruption.

The core argument is that the current system, despite reforms, remains
deeply flawed due to the continued entanglement of government officials
with businesses, leading to extortion and hindering economic
development. The author emphasizes the need for greater accountability
and a separation of power to effectively combat corruption and restore
economic efficiency. The text concludes by suggesting that tying a
government official’s prosperity solely to budget revenue could
incentivize ethical behavior rather than relying solely on punitive
measures.

<p>

The provided text details the ongoing, and largely stalled, fighting
between the US-led coalition and Iraqi forces in early March 2003. The
primary focus is on the battles around En-Nusayriyah and Umm-Qasr.

**En-Nusayriyah:** Heavy fighting resulted in a near-stalemate. The
Americans, facing fierce Iraqi resistance and significant casualties
(around 40 killed, 10 prisoners, 200 wounded), were unable to capture
the city. Iraqi forces inflicted considerable losses on the coalition,
and the situation led to a general withdrawal and regrouping by the
coalition.

**Umm-Qasr:** The situation was even more dire. Intense, continuous
bombing by the coalition, aimed at destroying the city, resulted in
near-total devastation. Despite this, pockets of Iraqi resistance
remained, and British forces, tasked with “clearing” the city, suffered
heavy losses (15 killed, 100 wounded) and were pushed back.

**Other Key Developments:**

-   **General Stalemate:** Across multiple fronts, coalition forces were
    experiencing difficulties and significant casualties.
-   **Heavy Casualties:** Both sides were sustaining heavy losses, with
    the coalition reporting approximately 180 killed and 800-1000
    wounded, while Iraq reported around 500 killed and 2000 wounded.
-   **Equipment Losses:** Significant amounts of military equipment were
    lost on both sides.
-   **Strategic Miscalculations:** The text suggests a critical
    strategic error by the US, initiating ground operations without
    sufficient coordination with air support. It also criticizes the US
    intelligence community for inaccurate assessments of Iraqi military
    capabilities.
-   **Ongoing Operations:** The text highlights continued operations
    including the deployment of US troops in northern Iraq, air strikes,
    and missile launches.

The overall picture is one of a protracted and costly conflict with no
clear victory in sight.

</p>
<p>

This lengthy text is a passionate and deeply reverent reflection on the
life and music of Sergei Rachmaninoff. It argues that Rachmaninoff’s
work is profoundly spiritual and connected to a deep Russian national
identity, often overlooked in modern interpretations. The author
contends that Rachmaninoff’s music isn’t simply beautiful or emotionally
evocative, but rather a conduit for a “tradition without words,” a
spiritual understanding of Russia’s soul.

The text emphasizes the importance of listening attentively to
Rachmaninoff’s music, seeking beyond surface-level impressions to
uncover its hidden depths and symbolic meanings. It criticizes
contemporary audiences for reducing his work to mere spectacle – “faster
and louder” – and for failing to recognize the profound spiritual
content embedded within his compositions.

Key themes explored include the connection between Rachmaninoff’s music
and Russian national identity, particularly the idea of a “tradition
without words,” the importance of spiritual understanding, and the need
to listen with a “living soul” to truly appreciate his work. The author
uses numerous examples, including specific pieces like “The Bright
Spot,” “The Pines,” “Vocalise,” and “The Isle of the Dead,” to
illustrate these points, drawing on the writings of figures like Nikolai
Metner and George Sviridov.

Ultimately, the text is a plea for a deeper, more attentive engagement
with Rachmaninoff’s music, urging readers to recognize it as a vital
expression of Russia’s spiritual heritage and a timeless testament to
the power of artistic expression. It’s a defense of Rachmaninoff’s
legacy against what the author perceives as a superficial and
spiritually impoverished understanding of his work.

This text is a first-person account from a veteran pensioner in Moscow
detailing his frustrating and bewildering experiences navigating the
city’s complex and constantly changing housing and utility payment
system. The author recounts numerous trips to various government offices
– the Sberbank, the “Unified Information and Calculation Center,” and
separate departments for gas and heat – all in an attempt to accurately
receive his entitlements as a veteran.

He describes a system riddled with bureaucratic inefficiency, shifting
regulations, and a seeming deliberate obfuscation of benefits. He
highlights how regulations change frequently, often without clear
communication, leaving pensioners struggling to understand their
obligations and receive the discounts they are entitled to. The author
expresses frustration with the lack of transparency, the constant need
to jump through hoops, and the feeling that the system is designed to
disadvantage elderly, low-income residents.

He laments the feeling of being treated as a problem rather than a
valued citizen, and suggests that the system is intentionally set up to
push vulnerable individuals into debt and reliance on private firms
offering dubious services. The text concludes with a cynical observation
about the potential for this system to be used to marginalize the
elderly and a warning that the experiences of ordinary pensioners are
often ignored by those in power.

misinterpreting the situation. He asserted that the U.S. was attempting
to portray Saddam Hussein as possessing weapons of mass destruction to

The text details the evolving landscape of dental care in Moscow
following the economic reforms of the 1990s. Initially, private dental
clinics flourished due to the urgent need for dental services and the
lack of options in the state-run polyclinics, which were plagued by long
queues and poor conditions. However, many clinics failed during the 1998
financial crisis. Despite this, private dentistry experienced a
resurgence, driven by increased demand for cosmetic dental procedures,
particularly metal-ceramic restorations.

The text contrasts the experiences of patients in private clinics versus
those in state-run polyclinics. Private clinics offered faster service,
more comfortable environments, and the use of anesthesia, but at a
higher cost. The quality of care varied significantly, with some clinics
prioritizing profit over patient well-being.

The author highlights the challenges faced by private dental practices,
including bureaucratic hurdles in obtaining and maintaining licenses,
the influence of organized crime (particularly the demand from recently
released prisoners), and the fluctuating economic climate. The text
emphasizes the importance of financial resources in the dental industry,
with the ability to pay influencing patient choices and the success of
clinics. It concludes with a cynical observation about the industry’s
reliance on a wealthy clientele and the potential for economic
instability to impact its future.

This text analyzes the strategic methods employed by the Kremlin,
particularly through its political technologists, to maintain power and
secure victory for the United Russia party. The core strategy involves a
multi-faceted approach including manipulating public opinion, creating a
broad coalition encompassing diverse figures (from oligarchs to military
leaders), and employing tactics like blaming external factors (such as
the KPFR) for economic problems, and utilizing social engineering
techniques including provocations and legislative changes. A key
criticism is that United Russia’s ambition to encompass *all* of Russian
society – a “quantum of generality” – creates an unsustainable and
ultimately fragile system, representing its critical weakness. The text

This text is a highly critical and conspiratorial analysis of the US-led
interventions in the Balkans, particularly the wars in Iraq and the
subsequent actions in Kosovo. It argues that the US’s motivations are
not humanitarian but driven by a relentless pursuit of global dominance,
specifically through control of oil resources.

Here’s a breakdown of the key arguments:

-   **US Imperialism:** The text portrays the US as a perpetually
    warring empire, constantly engaging in “business” – essentially,
    military conquest – to maintain its global influence. It frames US
    actions as a deliberate strategy to control resources, particularly
    oil.
-   **Manipulation of Events:** The author contends that the US
    deliberately manipulated events in the Balkans, orchestrating the
    assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Slobodan Milošević to
    destabilize the region and create an opportunity for US
    intervention.
-   **False Narratives:** The text accuses the US of fabricating
    justifications for its actions, such as “liberating” the people of

This text argues that Russia should not expect to receive the $8 billion
owed by Iraq from the United States. The author, Stanislav Bekhovsky,
believes Washington is demonstrating a lack of concern for other
nations’ interests, particularly after Paul Wolfowitz stated that
France, Germany, and Russia would not receive the debt repayment.
Russia’s past reliance on the US for global influence has left it
powerless, unable to influence decisions or secure concessions. The
author suggests Russia’s only realistic options are to sell the debt to
another nation (like China or Saudi Arabia) or convert it into
marketable securities, potentially with the support of Germany and
France. Ultimately, the author concludes that Russia should not continue
to seek favors from the US and that any attempt to do so will likely be
unsuccessful.

</p>
<p>

This text is a transcript of an interview with Юрий Boldyrev, a
prominent Russian author and critic, focusing on his observations of
Russia’s political and economic landscape. Boldyrev argues that Russia’s
problems stem from a fundamental disconnect between its aspirations and
its reality, particularly regarding the influence of Western ideas and
the corruption within the government. He believes that the “liberal
experiment” has been a disastrous failure, characterized by the
exploitation of power by elites and a lack of genuine public engagement.

Boldyrev criticizes the pervasive influence of money in Russian
politics, highlighting how Western ideas, particularly those promoted by
figures like Gaidar and Burbul, have been implemented without
considering Russia’s specific circumstances. He expresses skepticism
about the ability of the public to critically assess information,
particularly during election periods, and argues that the current system
is dominated by a small group of powerful individuals who manipulate the
narrative.

Ultimately, Boldyrev advocates for a more conscious and engaged
citizenry, suggesting that simply stating the truth is insufficient
without a genuine desire for change. He views the situation as a
struggle between those who genuinely seek to improve Russia and those
who exploit the system for personal gain, emphasizing the need for
vigilance and a rejection of simplistic solutions.

<p>

This text is a highly unusual and rambling monologue, blending
historical references, religious fervor, and paranoid anxieties. It
centers around a group calling themselves “horugvenostsy” (flag-bearers)
who believe they are engaged in a spiritual and historical battle for
Russia. The speaker expresses deep distrust of contemporary religious
figures, particularly those associated with “Radonezh,” and accuses them
of heresy and deception.

The core of the monologue revolves around the figure of Eugene Rodionov,
a soldier killed in a conflict, whom the group venerates as a martyr.
They believe he is a key figure in a coming apocalyptic event,
symbolized by a red flag and a “bagration” (crimson breath) – a sense of
impending war. The speaker uses a bizarre mix of historical figures –
Alexander Nevsky, Ivan the Terrible, Seraphim of Sarov – and
contemporary figures, accusing them of being manipulated by demonic
forces.

The text is filled with apocalyptic imagery, religious jargon, and a
deep sense of nationalistic paranoia. It culminates in a call to “be
ready” for a final, cataclysmic confrontation, suggesting a belief that
Russia is destined for a dramatic and potentially violent rebirth. The
entire piece feels like a fever dream, combining historical revisionism,
religious delusion, and a profound sense of unease.

Igor Sмирнов, a psychologist born in 1951, pioneered the use of
computers in psychotherapeutic techniques, developing a unique approach
combining psychoanalysis with computer technology. His methods involved
identifying “repertory points” and “locuses” – specific mental triggers
– to correct psychological issues. Sмирнов’s work involved observing and
documenting patient reactions, often involving unusual behaviors, and he
achieved success in treating conditions like psoriasis, addiction, and
depression, though his methods were often met with skepticism and
resistance from established medical professionals and government
officials. He viewed his work as a way to unlock the potential of the
human psyche, emphasizing the importance of understanding individual
differences and the potential for influencing thoughts and behaviors. He
believed in a scientific, rather than mystical, approach, and
highlighted the need for innovative tools like the “resonator” to
achieve this. Sмирнов’s work was frequently challenged and obstructed,
particularly by those resistant to the idea of using technology in
mental health treatment, and he expressed frustration with the lack of
support and the deliberate obstruction of his efforts. He saw himself as
a key figure in awakening the “Russian spirit” and promoting a more

<p>
This text critiques President Putin’s 2003 State of the Nation Address,
specifically his ambitious goal of doubling Russia’s GDP within ten
years. The author argues this goal was unrealistic, driven by political
motivations – namely, boosting Putin’s popularity and authority – rather
than genuine economic strategy. Achieving this doubling would have
required unsustainable growth rates (8% annually) or the sudden, massive
integration of Russia’s “shadow economy,” neither of which were
feasible. The author suggests the goal was essentially a smokescreen,
relying on attracting foreign investment from Western corporations, and
ultimately, a self-serving attempt to inflate Putin’s image.
Furthermore, the proposal for a “gold standard” for the ruble was viewed
as a naive and ultimately doomed attempt to bolster the currency, likely
leading to its devaluation and further economic hardship for the Russian
people, mirroring the fate of the Russian Empire. The author concludes
that Putin’s stated ambition was a deliberate misdirection, a “dividing
of the GDP” to achieve personal gain.

The text explores the apparent apathy of the Russian people,
particularly since the 1990s, and attempts to understand its causes and
potential solutions. It argues that this “sleep” – a state of passive
acceptance – is rooted in a demographic crisis, a loss of national
identity, and a historical tendency towards spiritual resignation.

Several key ideas are presented: the need for a strong, unifying leader
(a “Vozhd”) to awaken the nation; the importance of restoring a sense of
national purpose and identity; and the recognition that the current
situation is a consequence of historical factors, including a decline in
population and a loss of faith.

The text suggests that the Russian people are not inherently a
rebellious or active population, but rather a “sleeping” one, and that
waking them up requires a fundamental shift in national consciousness
and the emergence of a charismatic leader capable of inspiring action.
It emphasizes the need for a careful selection process for this leader,
wary of false prophets and opportunists. Ultimately, the text frames the
problem as a spiritual and national crisis, rather than a purely
political one, and calls for a renewed sense of national pride and
purpose.

2003-06-03 - <b> Mikhail Khazin </b>

<p>

This text is a pessimistic economic forecast of the United States,
written in June 2003. The author argues that despite recent dollar
decline and apparent economic activity, the U.S. economy is
fundamentally unstable and facing a prolonged crisis. He criticizes the
U.S. government’s approach, characterizing it as reactive and based on
short-term tactical decisions rather than strategic planning.

The core argument is that the U.S. economy is deeply flawed due to a
disconnect between its high-quality, skilled workforce and the products
it produces (like industrial machinery), leading to persistent trade
deficits. The author predicts a continued dollar decline, a falling
stock market, and ultimately, a severe economic downturn, possibly
resembling the 1929-30 crisis.

He expresses skepticism about the government’s ability to resolve the
situation, attributing it to a lack of strategic foresight and a
tendency to react to problems rather than proactively address them. The
author emphasizes the importance of recognizing the outdated nature of
previous analyses and forecasts, suggesting that the current situation
was already evident six months prior. He concludes with a warning that
the U.S. economy is heading for a significant and potentially
catastrophic collapse, and that relying on current analyses is

This text is a detailed review and analysis of Vladimir Bondarenko’s
book, “Flaming Reactionaries: Three Faces of Russian Patriotism.” The
book is presented as a comprehensive encyclopedia of Russian patriotic
thought from the late 20th century, profiling fifty key figures –
artists, writers, intellectuals, and public figures – united by their
love for Russia and their service to it.

Bondarenko groups these figures into three “faces” of Russian
patriotism: the “Red” (communist-leaning), the “White,” and the
“Russian” (a more eclectic group encompassing figures who didn’t fit
neatly into either category). The reviewer emphasizes the book’s
ambition and scope, highlighting its attempt to capture a diverse range
of perspectives within the Russian patriotic movement.

The reviewer notes the book’s somewhat controversial nature,
particularly its portrayal of figures like Leonid Borodin and Alexander
Prokhanov, and acknowledges the potential for disagreement among
readers. However, they ultimately praise Bondarenko’s work as a valuable
contribution to understanding the complex and often contradictory
currents of Russian patriotic thought. The reviewer also touches on the

copious amounts of soap. The operation was overseen by figures like
Viktor Grishin, Valentina Matviienko, and even Mikhail Kodaev,
highlighting a state-wide effort to cleanse itself. Throughout the
meeting, Putin adopted a regal persona, requesting to be addressed as
“Your Majesty,” and made cryptic remarks about shaping leaders. Boris
Березовский, observing Putin, was concerned about the President’s plans
to establish a monarchy, based on genealogical research. The meeting

soap over oneself by Lord Judd.

The arrival of Eduard Limonov in Moscow, a distant relative of the
writer B. Savinov, was met with diverse reactions – some celebratory,
others critical of the government. Despite this, Limonov’s arrival at
the Paveletsky Station, facilitated by his supporters, signaled a new
phase of the “Limonov” project, which is now fragmented into numerous
sub-projects with varying goals. This project exists within the
National-Bolshievist Party, which has grown significantly since
Limonov’s imprisonment, and also within the Presidential Administration,
who intend to utilize him as a tool against the CPRF. Limonov’s
inclusion in the CPRF’s Central Election List is anticipated, and
“Zavtra” newspaper continues to support him and his party.

AMERICAN HOLE Excerpts from a new novel.
</h3>

<p>
2003-07-08 - <b> Pavel Krusanov </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a darkly humorous and surreal conversation between a
narrator and Sergei Abbarbarchuk, the enigmatic head of the
“Lemminaikenen” firm. The firm specializes in orchestrating elaborate,
often absurd, acts of revenge and disruption, frequently involving
bizarre scenarios and exploiting cultural misunderstandings. Their
current project involves a disgruntled Kyrgyz businessman and a planned
“sheep-slaughtering” event incorporated into the Olympic Games. The
firm’s methods are chaotic and seemingly without logic, relying on
exploiting vulnerabilities and creating situations that maximize
confusion and embarrassment. Abbarbarchuk’s philosophy is rooted in a
cynical view of human nature, suggesting that people are inherently
prone to foolishness and that the best approach is to amplify these
tendencies. The conversation is filled with digressions, tangents, and
bizarre details, highlighting the firm’s unconventional approach and the
narrator’s fascination with its operations. Ultimately, the text
portrays a world where chaos and absurdity are deliberately cultivated
as a means of achieving a desired outcome.

The text critiques the concept of “Semy” (Family), a nebulous and
corrupting force that emerged in Russia following the collapse of the
Soviet Union. It describes “Semy” as a collection of powerful, often
shadowy figures – including oligarchs, former KGB officials, and
political elites – who exploited the post-Soviet transition for personal
gain. The author argues that “Semy” is characterized by irrationality,
manipulation, and a disregard for national interests. The rise of
Vladimir Putin is portrayed as an attempt to dismantle “Semy,” but the
author expresses skepticism, suggesting that the underlying forces of
corruption and self-interest will continue to shape Russian politics.
The text highlights the ongoing struggle between those seeking to reform
Russia and those entrenched within “Semy,” ultimately concluding that
“Semy” represents a persistent threat to genuine national development
and that its members should be treated with suspicion and hostility.

“UNION OF THE WEAKEST” Why was Glazev allotted a place in the Kremlin
wall?
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2003-07-22 - <b> Stanislav Belkovskiy </b>
</p>
<p>

This text outlines a cynical and calculated scheme by the Kremlin,
primarily through figures like V.Yu. Surkov and Alexander Voloshin, to
create a “New Left Bloc” (SLS) – a deliberately weak and unstable
political construct. The core strategy involves exploiting Sergei
Glazev, a 42-year-old academic and Duma deputy, as a pawn.

The plan centers around creating a temporary, highly controlled “left”
opposition to the Communist Party of Russia (CPR), led by Glazev. The
goal isn’t genuine political reform, but rather to sow discord within
the CPR, gather votes for the Kremlin’s own purposes, and ultimately
discredit Zyganov.

Glazev is presented as a disposable tool, initially given a “Kinder
Surprise” – a temporary role with funding and support, but ultimately
destined to be discarded once he’s no longer useful. The scheme involves
creating a network of regional offices, manipulating media attention,
and even proposing a temporary alliance with Mikhail Gorbachev to
further destabilize the CPR.

The text portrays a deeply cynical and pragmatic approach, prioritizing
Kremlin control and image management over any genuine ideological or
political goals. Glazev’s fate is predetermined: he will be used,
manipulated, and ultimately discarded, a typical example of how the
Kremlin treats political figures as expendable assets. The overall tone
is one of detached amusement and a recognition of the inherent
instability of the project.

</p>
<p>

This text recounts Mikhail Titov’s experiences during the early years of
World War II, specifically focusing on his time with the 5th Rifle
Division. Titov describes the division’s formation, its initial
preparations, and its involvement in the battles around Pripyat and the
subsequent fighting during the summer and autumn of 1941. He emphasizes
the division’s unfortunate situation – being prematurely deployed and
poorly prepared for combat, leading to heavy losses of equipment and
personnel.

Titov details the division’s struggles during the summer of 1942,
particularly during the Rzhevsky operation, highlighting the chaotic
nature of the fighting and the division’s constant rotations and
resupply challenges. He describes the division’s eventual transformation
into the 44th Guards Division after the war.

Crucially, Titov corrects the common misconception that the division
“lost” the first phase of the war, arguing instead that the Germans
failed to achieve their initial objectives – capturing Moscow,
Leningrad, and Kiev. He attributes the German failure to the Soviet
resistance and the division’s own experiences. He also provides a
detailed account of the division’s food supply, noting the difficulties
in obtaining adequate rations, particularly meat, and the impact of the
war on the morale of the soldiers. Finally, he offers a nuanced
perspective on the relationship between the command staff and
commissars, emphasizing the importance of both figures in maintaining
morale and discipline.

The Istrinsky Reserve foresters are alarmed by the disappearance of
deer, wild boars, and the prolonged lack of hibernation among animals
like otters and badgers. The author attributes this to the actions of
the Moscow region governor, who repeatedly issues hunting permits that
are poorly regulated, leading to excessive and destructive hunting
activity. He describes widespread illegal shooting and the acquisition
of firearms by untrained individuals. Furthermore, a widespread rabies
epidemic among domestic animals, exacerbated by poor vaccination
standards, is driving wildlife out of the region, leading to targeted
shooting of animals. The author argues that this situation represents a
decline in civilization and a return to a more primitive state due to
overpopulation and unregulated hunting.

<p>
2003-08-12 - <b> Sergey Dorenko </b>
</p>
<p>

This text presents a critical analysis of Russia’s current political and
economic situation, arguing for a radical shift towards a nationalized
economy driven by a revitalized, independent small and medium business
sector. The author contends that Russia’s problems stem from a corrupt,
oligarch-dominated system that stifles innovation and economic growth.

The core argument is for a “bourgeois revolution” – not in the
traditional sense, but one focused on empowering the nation’s small and
medium-sized businesses, who are seen as the key to genuine economic
modernization and national strength. This would involve nationalizing
natural resource extraction and processing, alongside creating a legal
and supportive environment for these businesses to thrive.

The author identifies significant risks, particularly the potential for
a power struggle between factions within the elite, and the likely
resistance of entrenched oligarchs. They also highlight the importance
of a strong, independent business sector as the foundation for a truly
democratic and prosperous Russia, suggesting that Vladimir Putin’s role
would likely be to manage the transition rather than lead it.
Ultimately, the text advocates for a fundamental restructuring of the
Russian economy, prioritizing national interests and the empowerment of
its entrepreneurial base.

Russian passions about “black gold” predict leadership in global oil
exports. But at the cost of losing the prospects for the development of
the domestic economy.
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2003-08-12 - <b> Vladimir Popov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a 2003 analysis of the Russian economy, primarily focusing
on the declining global oil market, the impact of diminishing oil
reserves, and the complex interplay of economic and political forces
within Russia. It argues that Russia’s reliance on oil revenue is
creating significant economic vulnerabilities, exacerbated by a system
where oil wealth is largely controlled by a small group of oligarchs.

The core argument is that Russia’s oil reserves are dwindling rapidly,
with projections showing a significant decline in global oil production
and a shift in oil production towards Muslim-majority countries. The
text highlights the consequences of this shift, including the limited
lifespan of Russia’s own oil reserves (estimated at 22 years by British
Petroleum) and the potential for economic stagnation.

It critiques the current economic model, characterized by a focus on
extracting oil revenue without investing in diversification or
sustainable economic development. The author points to issues such as
the underinvestment in industrial development, the manipulation of asset
values by oligarchs, and the lack of transparency in the oil sector.

Several key figures and analyses are referenced, including Vladimir
Popov (a top-level energy executive), Daniel Yergin (a renowned
historian of the oil industry), and Anatoly Chubais (a former economic
advisor to Yeltsin). The text also draws on the perspectives of figures
like Boris Березовский (Boris Berezovsky), offering a critical
assessment of the oligarchic system and the need for a more balanced
approach to economic development.

Ultimately, the text paints a picture of a Russia facing significant
economic challenges due to its dependence on oil, warning of potential
instability and urging a shift towards a more diversified and
sustainable economic model. It suggests that the current system, driven
by the extraction of oil revenue, is unsustainable and poses a serious
threat to the country’s long-term economic future.

<p>
2003-08-19 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text presents a critical analysis of “international terrorism,”
arguing it’s a continuation of policies pursued by powerful nations
seeking global dominance. It frames the phenomenon as a deliberate
strategy, rather than a spontaneous uprising, fueled by a desire to
control resources and impose a specific worldview – a “cultural
hegemony.”

The core argument is that events like the September 11th attacks were
not accidental but orchestrated, likely involving the deliberate use of
misinformation and manipulation to achieve strategic goals. The text
suggests that the US military and intelligence agencies actively engaged
in psychological warfare, employing “agents of influence” to destabilize
foreign societies and promote American values.

It highlights the role of powerful nations, particularly the US, in
creating and perpetuating conflict through strategic interventions,
economic pressure, and the dissemination of propaganda. The author
contends that the concept of “international terrorism” is a tool used to
justify these actions, obscuring the underlying motives of global power
dynamics. The text concludes with a warning about the dangers of this
“strategic influence” and suggests that the US is a “state-terrorist,”
actively engaged in manipulating global events for its own benefit.

The author argues that the collapse of the Soviet Union wasn’t the
result of grand conspiracies, historical forces, or ideological shifts,
but rather the consequence of individual failings and decisions made by
a small number of people. He posits that the key players – figures like
those depicted in Alexander Prokhanov’s novel “The Last Soldier of the
Empire” – acted in isolation, making crucial, often flawed, choices that
ultimately led to the USSR’s demise. The author emphasizes the role of
individual heroism and resilience, suggesting that a small group of
resolute individuals, even in isolation, could resist the collapse. He
frames this as a “stoicism of the loners,” highlighting the importance
of personal conviction and action over collective movements or
established ideologies. The narrative concludes by portraying these
individuals as the last vestiges of Soviet spirit, embodying a defiant,
solitary resistance that would later inspire a new wave of Russian

This text details a cynical critique of Vladimir Putin’s leadership,
particularly focusing on his handling of the Chechen conflicts and the
broader state of Russia. The author expresses skepticism about Putin’s
claims of being a strong, patriotic leader, arguing that he has simply
exploited a nationalistic fervor to maintain power.

The core argument is that Putin’s actions, particularly the disastrous
second Chechen war, have revealed a lack of genuine leadership and have
exacerbated existing problems within Russia. The author uses the example
of the 300th anniversary celebrations in St. Petersburg, highlighting
the massive, wasteful spending on a lavish event while neglecting
critical needs within the military and the economy.

The text argues that Putin’s image as a “defender of the army” is a
carefully constructed facade, masking the reality of a decaying
military, a corrupt system, and a growing threat of terrorism. The
author points to the continued instability in Chechnya, the ongoing loss
of Russian soldiers, and the widespread corruption within the government
as evidence of Putin’s failures.

Ultimately, the text portrays Putin as a skilled manipulator who has
successfully convinced the Russian public that he is a strong leader,

Genadiy Zuyganov, leader of the CPRF, outlines the party’s strategy for
the upcoming elections, framing them as a battle against a deeply flawed
and destructive “reformed” Russia. He describes a bleak picture of
contemporary Russia – characterized by widespread disasters (fires,
floods, famine, freezing temperatures, violence), corruption, and a
crumbling economy fueled by oligarchs and a dysfunctional government. He
argues that the current leadership is fundamentally opposed to the
Russian people and is actively working to destroy the nation’s
traditions and values.

Zuyganov identifies the key enemy as the entire “party of power,”
encompassing corrupt officials, oligarchs, and a manipulative media
apparatus. He accuses the government of deliberately fostering despair
and division through misinformation and propaganda. He emphasizes the
need to defend the Russian people, particularly the Russian nation,
against what he sees as a systematic attempt to erase Russian culture
and identity.

The CPRF’s strategy centers on mobilizing the Russian population against
this perceived threat. This includes a focus on restoring traditional
Russian values, supporting Russian families, and defending the Russian
nation’s territorial integrity. Zuyganov calls for a radical overhaul of
the political system, including measures to combat corruption, protect
Russian families, and restore the nation’s economic strength. He frames
the elections as a crucial battle for the future of Russia, urging
voters to support the CPRF as the only viable alternative to the current

2003-08-26 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy critique and commentary on the increasing trend
of proposing historical figures, particularly Tsar John IV “Grozny”
(Ivan the Terrible), for canonization within the Russian Orthodox
Church. The author expresses strong reservations about this practice,
arguing it reflects a weakness in canonical understanding and a
potential for provocation.

The core argument is that while the Church is actively engaged in
identifying and canonizing new saints, the suggestion of canonizing
figures like Grozny or Grigory Rasputin is deeply problematic. It’s seen
as a result of a lack of solid theological grounding and a potential for
misleading the faithful. The author highlights the need to distinguish
between true saints – those embodying Christ-like virtues – and figures
who, despite historical significance, may be morally questionable.

The text specifically addresses the concerns surrounding the proposed
canonization of Grozny, emphasizing the historical context of his reign,
marked by brutality and oppression, and contrasting it with the
established canon of martyrs and righteous figures. It questions the
motivations behind such proposals, suggesting they may be driven by
deliberate attempts to undermine the Church’s authority.

Furthermore, the author raises the broader issue of the potential for
canonizing other controversial historical figures, suggesting a need for
careful discernment and a firm adherence to established theological
principles. The text concludes with a warning against the indiscriminate
veneration of individuals, stressing the importance of upholding the
Church’s tradition of honoring only those who are truly worthy of
sainthood.

This text is a cynical and critical account of the situation in
Abkhazia, particularly focusing on Russia’s relationship with the region
and the consequences of the 2008 war. It details the ten-year
anniversary of Abkhazia’s victory (and blockade) and highlights the
ongoing issues of displacement, economic hardship, and the lack of
genuine progress.

The author argues that Russia’s involvement is driven by a cynical
desire to prevent a potentially destabilizing anti-Russian state in the
region, rather than genuine concern for the Abkhaz people. The “victory”
celebrated is viewed as a consequence of Georgia’s aggressive actions
and the subsequent blockade, leaving Abkhazia impoverished and isolated.

Key criticisms include the lack of transparency surrounding the reasons
for the blockade, the exploitation of Abkhazia’s resources (tourism,
tea, citrus fruits), and the corruption and criminality that have
flourished in the absence of a stable government. The author expresses
frustration with the bureaucratic inefficiency and the disregard for
Abkhaz lives by Russian officials.

The text emphasizes the stark contrast between the restored Suhumskaya
naberezhna (promenade) – a symbol of a bygone era of Soviet tourism –
and the grim realities of daily life for Abkhaz people. It concludes
with a poignant observation about an elderly Abkhaz farmer selling
tomatoes at the market, representing a resilient spirit amidst the

tourist-filled hub with a thriving red-light district, alongside a
surprisingly normal European capital. They encounter a range of

seeking a simple tourist experience.

The narrative highlights the contradictions of the Netherlands,
particularly regarding drug use, which appears to be more tolerated than
in other European countries. It explores the impact of this tolerance,
suggesting it contributes to a broader issue of drug trafficking
throughout Europe. The journey also touches on the cultural differences
between the Netherlands and Germany, noting the German character as
being a blend of Viking-like determination and romanticism.

Ultimately, the text presents a nuanced view of Europe, suggesting that
while the Schengen Agreement facilitates travel, it also allows for the

This text is a critical analysis of the sale of a controlling stake in
YUKOS to Western energy companies, primarily Chevron-Texaco, and its
implications for Russia’s energy sector and economy. The author argues
that the deal is deeply flawed and strategically detrimental to Russia,
comparing it to the historical “Seven Sisters” oil cartel and the
exploitation of Russia’s oil resources.

The core argument is that the sale represents a significant loss of
control over Russia’s vast oil reserves and the associated revenue
(rent). The author expresses skepticism about the stated motivations of
the Western companies, suggesting they are primarily focused on
maximizing profits rather than contributing to Russia’s economic
development.

Key points include:

-   **Historical Parallel:** The situation is likened to the historical
    dominance of the “Seven Sisters” oil companies, highlighting a
    pattern of Western exploitation of Russia’s resources.
-   **Strategic Detriment:** The sale is viewed as a loss of control
    over a vital national asset, with potentially negative consequences
    for Russia’s economic growth.
-   **Lack of Transparency:** The author expresses concern about the
    lack of transparency surrounding the deal and the motivations of the
    involved parties.
-   **Doubts about Investment:** There is skepticism about the extent to
    which Western companies will invest in Russia’s energy sector, given
    their primary focus on extracting profits.
-   **Call for Caution:** The text urges caution and a critical
    assessment of the deal’s long-term implications for Russia’s energy
    future.

Essentially, the author paints a picture of a strategically
disadvantageous deal driven by Western interests, potentially leading to
Russia’s continued dependence on foreign capital and control over its
own natural resources.

2003-10-07 - <b> Aleksandr Prokhanov </b>
</p>
<p>
This text presents a cyclical and somewhat fantastical vision of
Russia’s history and future, framed as an “empire” repeatedly rising and
falling. It argues that Russia’s strength and identity are intrinsically
linked to its imperial ambitions, tracing a history through the Tsarist
era, the Soviet Union, and a potential future. The text emphasizes the
recurring need for a strong, centralized “imperial layer” – represented
by figures like Lukashenko and the Soviet industrialization – to counter
localized and “sickly” elites. It depicts Russia as a “techno-imperial”
force, utilizing infrastructure like pipelines and railways to unify the
vast territory. The narrative suggests a cyclical destiny, driven by a
desire to overcome “death,” and envisions Russia as a powerful,
technologically advanced empire, collecting diverse cultures and
knowledge. The author uses evocative imagery – “imperial scars,”
“imperial instincts,” and comparisons to figures like Scobelev and a
“sticky” Putin – to build this argument.

TRAVEL FROM UKRAINE TO RUSSIA
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2003-10-14 - <b> Valeriy Pozdnyakov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a cynical and critical reflection on the political and
social situation in Russia and Ukraine in 2003, framed as a personal
narrative. The author recounts his experiences traveling through Russia
and Ukraine, highlighting the consequences of the 1991 division of the
Soviet Union and the subsequent policies of the Russian government. He
expresses frustration with the manipulation of historical events,
particularly the celebration of “independence” as a tool for national
division and exploitation.

The core of the text is a scathing critique of the Russian government’s
policies, focusing on the use of bureaucratic hurdles, excessive
registration fees, and discriminatory practices against foreign citizens
(particularly those from Ukraine) to extract wealth and control. The
author details instances of corruption, exploitation, and the
dehumanizing effects of these policies, exemplified by the absurd and
burdensome registration process for foreign workers and the treatment of
individuals like the Ukrainian migrant worker, Anatoly Tepenev, who is
subjected to harassment and extortion by Russian border guards.

Ultimately, the text argues that the division of the Soviet Union has
created a system where national identity is used as a tool for economic
exploitation, and where the government actively seeks to maintain this
division through bureaucratic manipulation and discriminatory practices.
The author’s personal experiences serve as a microcosm of this broader
societal problem, illustrating the human cost of political division and
the abuse of power.

</p>
<p>
The text is a transcript of an interview between journalist Valentin
Prousakov and the Ambassador of Tanzania to Russia, Patrick Chokala. The
conversation focuses on Tanzania’s political stability, economic
situation, and tourism industry. Tanzania has enjoyed decades of peace
and stability since its formation in 1964, largely due to its diverse
religious and ethnic makeup and a multi-party political system.
Economically, Tanzania is an agricultural nation with significant
resources including gold, diamonds, and a unique gemstone called
tanzanite. They export agricultural products and increasingly, fish and
manufactured goods. Tourism is a major contributor to the economy,
driven by attractions like Mount Kilimanjaro, the Serengeti and
Ngorongoro conservation areas, and the country’s rich biodiversity.
Despite a historical connection with the Soviet Union through student
exchanges, current relations are developing, with the Ambassador’s
primary goal being to increase Russian tourism to Tanzania. He believes
a lack of information contributes to hesitancy and hopes for a future
increase in both tourism and broader bilateral relations.

<p>
Russia is grappling with a lack of strategic direction regarding the Far
East, particularly concerning energy pipeline routes to China or
Southeast Asia/Japan. The Kremlin lacks a long-term vision, oscillating
between seeking independent global influence and remaining a subordinate
to the United States. The Korean Peninsula situation is critical, with
North Korea considering nuclear weapons to deter the US, while the US
maintains a strong military presence and is unwilling to compromise. The
US’s involvement in costly and protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
limits its ability to escalate tensions with North Korea. Diplomatic
efforts involving Russia, China, South Korea, and Japan are seen as a
potential path forward, but North Korea remains cautious and
unpredictable, awaiting the opportune moment to formally assert its
nuclear capabilities. The anniversary of the creation of the Workers’
Party of Korea is a significant date being closely watched for potential
announcements.

Yuri Petukhov’s “Life No. 8, or The Hunt for Presidents” is a new and
challenging work for the author, leaning towards postmodernism but
prioritizing emotional impact over traditional stylistic conventions.
The novel, published in 2003, depicts a dystopian, collapsing Russia,
portrayed as so bizarre and horrifying that conventional realism fails.
It features a protagonist, President фон Каппутинг, who is revealed to
be a series of incongruous identities – a soldier, a criminal, and so on
– reflecting a chaotic and disillusioned worldview. The narrative is
complex and unsettling, guided by a “human-hating” character, and aims
to provoke a raw, unvarnished response from the reader, demanding a
rejection of conventional perspectives. The book is described as
profoundly disturbing and requires a strong constitution to fully
appreciate its unsettling vision of a fractured reality.

This text is a poignant and somewhat melancholic portrait of a
struggling, isolated rural community in the Pudozhsky district of
Karelia, Russia. It describes a village clinging to a fading way of
life, marked by poverty, dwindling population, and a sense of
stagnation. The narrative focuses on a solitary, aging “chemist” named
Boris, and the efforts of a small group of individuals, including a
priest and a group of young boys from a children’s home, attempting to
revitalize the community.

The story highlights the decline of traditional rural life, the impact
of urbanization and economic hardship, and the challenges of preserving
cultural heritage and religious faith in a remote area. Despite the
difficulties, there’s a thread of hope woven through the narrative,
represented by the arrival of new people and the efforts to rebuild a
church and provide opportunities for the children. The text evokes a
sense of nostalgia for a simpler, more connected way of life, while also
acknowledging the complexities and uncertainties of the present.

potential influence within the military. Simultaneously, there are
concerns about US-Russia relations, including a shift in US diplomatic
positions regarding the Yukos case and growing anxieties about the Iraq

viewed with skepticism, suggesting a “bubble” and potential statistical

Unrest in Georgia, potentially leading to civil conflict, is seen as an

This text, written in 2003, outlines a strategic assessment for the
Communist Party of Russia (KПРФ) regarding its future and approach to
opposition. It argues that the party’s current strategy of short-term
tactical maneuvering is insufficient, particularly in the context of the
looming 2008 elections and the “Operation Precursor” attack on Yukos.
The core recommendations are: 1) Develop a new, modernized platform that
moves beyond outdated ideological positions and appeals to a broader
audience. 2) Implement a youth-focused personnel strategy, incorporating
skilled professionals and modernizing the party’s operations. 3)
Actively dismantle negative perceptions of the opposition through bold,
unconventional, and impactful public actions. The author stresses the
need for unity and a shift from short-term electoral tactics to a
long-term strategy focused on consolidating power and mobilizing public
support, ultimately aiming to break free from internal divisions and
establish the opposition as a proactive force. The text emphasizes the
importance of a coordinated, long-term approach, viewing the next four

welfare and housing in Russia. Korablin’s ideas, centered around
eliminating social benefits and reducing the living standards of

sentiment in Belarus and, to a lesser extent, Estonia, focusing on the
romanticized and often distorted narratives surrounding figures like
“the Black Cat” (a Belarusian nationalist figure) and the “Erny
brothers” (Estonian partisans). The author argues that these narratives,
fueled by a desire to rewrite history and create a sense of national
victimhood, are being deliberately promoted to sow discord and
potentially destabilize the region, particularly towards Russia.

The core argument is that these nationalist movements aren’t driven by
genuine historical concerns but rather by a calculated effort to
manipulate public opinion. The author highlights how these groups
selectively emphasize certain events – like the actions of “leсные

and ultimately, the failure of their nationalist ambitions.

Specifically, the text details how these groups are using the past to
justify contemporary anti-Russian sentiment and potentially pave the way
for further political instability. It criticizes the manipulation of
historical memory, portraying these figures as heroic when, in reality,
they were often involved in terrorism and violence. The author concludes

This text is a lengthy, polemical essay exploring the complex and

manipulation of national identity and the perpetuation of anti-Semitic
sentiment. The author argues that a significant portion of Jewish
individuals and organizations have historically exploited national
tensions and prejudices for their own benefit, creating a system of

The core argument revolves around the idea that Jewish communities,

The author draws upon historical figures like Marx and figures like

The text expresses concern about the continued influence of Jewish
