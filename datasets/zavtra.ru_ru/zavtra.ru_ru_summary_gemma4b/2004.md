</p>
<p>
The text is a collection of letters to a newspaper column titled “To
Eugene About Some People.” The letters express a range of opinions and
criticisms, primarily focused on Russian politics, media, and cultural
events. Concerns include the perceived manipulation of the public
through media, the absurdity of political figures and their names,
criticisms of the government and its policies, and a general sense of
disillusionment with the state of affairs. There are comments about the
influence of foreign powers (specifically the US), the perceived
cynicism of political figures, and a desire for continued communication
and engagement.

The text recounts the story of Galya, a former seamstress who repeatedly
reinvented herself in various schemes, including selling cosmetics and
then offering “psychology” services after attending an intensive
training program. She became a globally recognized, albeit questionable,
psychologist, lecturing and offering services worldwide. The narrative
critiques this phenomenon, portraying Galya and others like her as
exploiting vulnerable individuals seeking help, particularly during
difficult times. It highlights a broader societal issue of unqualified
individuals posing as experts, capitalizing on people’s desperation and
trust, and ultimately contributing to a landscape of misinformation and
potentially harmful advice.

ASIDE FROM KASSY
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-01-14 - <b> Denis Tukmakov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a darkly humorous and somewhat surreal exploration of
sports betting, specifically focusing on the dynamics between bettors
and bookmakers. It depicts a world where sports betting is a highly
competitive, almost ritualistic activity, driven by a combination of
statistical analysis, insider knowledge, and sheer luck.

The narrative centers around a shadowy figure – a “hunter” – who
meticulously researches upcoming sporting events, analyzing odds and
seeking discrepancies. He operates within a network of bettors,
“dogoners,” “vilochniki,” and “parovozniki,” all driven by a desire to
exploit the perceived flaws in the bookmakers’ lines. The text
highlights the inherent instability of the betting market, where
information is constantly shifting and where the bookmakers themselves
are often prone to errors.

It emphasizes the psychological aspects of betting, portraying bettors
as obsessive, almost fanatical figures, driven by a desire to prove
their intelligence and exploit the system. The story uses vivid imagery
and a somewhat absurd tone to illustrate the competitive and often
chaotic nature of the betting world, suggesting that success is as much
about understanding the psychology of the market as it is about
analyzing statistics. The text ultimately suggests that sports betting
is a game of deception, manipulation, and ultimately, a struggle against
a system designed to profit from the hopes and dreams of its
participants.

NEW ORTHODOX PROSE
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-01-14 - <b> Vladimir Bondarenko </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, somewhat rambling reflection on contemporary
Russian literature, particularly focusing on a perceived resurgence of
Orthodox themes and a critique of various literary trends. The author
expresses skepticism towards what he sees as overly stylized or “holy”
writing, particularly those of figures like Valentin Rasputin and Sergei
Yesenin, arguing they often prioritize aesthetic concerns over genuine
spiritual depth.

He views a new wave of Russian writers – including figures like
Alexander Prokhanov, Yuri Mamleyev, and Sergei Esin – as attempting to
grapple with contemporary moral and spiritual challenges, often through
a lens of Orthodox belief. The author is critical of this trend,
suggesting it can be overly simplistic or reliant on outdated tropes. He
highlights the importance of a grounded, realistic approach to
storytelling, drawing parallels to the enduring value of Russian
folklore and the need for writers to confront the “earthly hell” of the
present.

The text repeatedly emphasizes the need for humility and a servant-like
attitude in writing, contrasting this with what he perceives as
self-important or overly stylized approaches. He expresses a desire for
writers to genuinely engage with the struggles of the human condition,
rather than simply imposing pre-conceived religious ideas. The author
ultimately suggests that a truly authentic voice in contemporary Russian
literature will emerge from a commitment to honesty, realism, and a
willingness to confront difficult truths, regardless of religious
affiliation.

Exhausted discourse
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-01-14 - <b> Aleksey Lapshin </b>
</p>
<p>
The text explores the disconnect between the rapid evolution of societal
foundations and the often lagging development of cultural and
ideological “overhangs,” particularly within the “new left” tradition.
It critiques the wholesale adoption of post-structuralist thinkers like
Derrida and Deleuze, arguing that their deconstructive approach, while
aiming to dismantle oppressive systems, ultimately leads to a loss of
critical agency and a vulnerability to manipulation by powerful forces
(represented by the “System” and global brands). The rapid shift in the
societal base has outpaced the ability of these intellectual currents to
provide meaningful resistance. The text suggests that the “new left’s”
focus on dismantling established structures has inadvertently
strengthened the very system they sought to oppose, leading to a
situation where genuine freedom is replaced by a controlled form of
chaos. Ultimately, a fundamental shift in consciousness – a “revolution
in consciousness” – is deemed necessary, rooted in a rejection of
exploitation and a recognition of a defined purpose within history.

This text is a lengthy, reflective piece detailing the author’s evolving
perspective on Yuriandropov, the former head of the KGB and General
Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Initially, the
author viewed Andropov with a degree of respect, but after his sudden
death in 1984, his image underwent a significant transformation. The
author recounts the numerous controversies and unexplained events
surrounding Andropov’s life and death – including his suspected
involvement in the deaths of several high-ranking Soviet officials – and
how these fueled a shift in public perception.

The piece explores the author’s growing skepticism regarding Andropov’s
role in shaping Soviet history, particularly his influence over the
political landscape and the circumstances surrounding his demise. It
highlights the author’s observations during the funeral, noting the
strange and unsettling atmosphere, and the subsequent attempts to
rehabilitate Andropov’s image decades later. The author expresses
concern about the manipulation of Andropov’s legacy, particularly the
efforts to portray him as a brilliant and culturally significant leader,
while downplaying the darker aspects of his career and the questionable
methods he employed. Ultimately, the text is a critical examination of
historical memory and the ways in which narratives can be shaped and
distorted over time.

Without a holiday Marginal notes
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-02-04 - <b> Aleksandr Masay </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, critical examination of the state of
celebrations and “festivities” in contemporary Russia, arguing that a
genuine, unifying “holiday culture” has been systematically eroded. The
author traces this decline back to the early 20th century, specifically
citing the Bolsheviks’ suppression of traditional religious and national
celebrations, and continues to highlight the ongoing manipulation of
public events for political gain.

The core argument is that the current “festivities” – often
characterized by superficial displays, commercialization, and a lack of
genuine cultural significance – represent a symptom of a broader
societal malaise: a fragmented, disillusioned, and ultimately
impoverished national spirit. The author expresses concern that the
absence of meaningful celebrations contributes to a decline in national
identity and a susceptibility to manipulation.

The text laments the prioritization of “jubilee” celebrations (e.g.,
350th anniversaries) over genuine cultural expression and emphasizes the
importance of restoring a vibrant, unifying holiday culture as a crucial
element in the struggle to reclaim Russia’s national identity. It
concludes with a stark warning: a nation without genuine celebrations is
a nation on the path to cultural and spiritual decline.

This text is a lengthy, somewhat rambling, and cynical memoir reflecting
on the Soviet era, specifically focusing on the role of the KGB and its
impact on individuals. It details a personal experience involving a
student unfairly denied admission to a technical university due to the
actions of KGB officials, highlighting a pattern of manipulation and
injustice. The author recounts how the KGB, through its agents within
educational institutions, systematically targeted and discriminated
against individuals based on their national origin (in this case, Jewish
students). The narrative emphasizes the pervasive atmosphere of
suspicion and control within the Soviet system, where the KGB operated
with impunity, using its influence to undermine academic merit and
perpetuate social divisions. The author describes a broader trend of the
KGB’s involvement in manipulating educational outcomes and creating
obstacles for individuals deemed undesirable by the regime. The text
ultimately portrays a bleak picture of Soviet society, characterized by
bureaucratic corruption, ideological repression, and the abuse of power
by the security apparatus. It concludes with a reflection on the
enduring legacy of this system and the psychological impact of living
under constant surveillance and control.

This text is a lengthy astrological prediction and analysis of Russian
President Vladimir Putin’s life and political career, primarily focusing
on the years 2004-2006. It argues that Putin’s astrological chart,
dominated by the signs of the Dragon (1952) and Scales (Libra),
significantly influences his personality and actions.

The core argument is that while 2000-2004 were a “lucky” period marked
by his rise to power and electoral victories, the following years,
particularly 2005 and 2006, will be fraught with challenges and “heavy
choices” due to the astrological configuration. These challenges include
potential political instability, threats of terrorism and disaster, and
personal difficulties for Putin himself.

The text emphasizes Putin’s tendency towards making difficult decisions,
his reliance on personal connections rather than formal rules, and his
potential for psychological strain. It suggests that his success hinges
on fulfilling his campaign promises and acknowledging the serious
problems facing the country. The prediction highlights a period of
increased danger and potential upheaval, urging Putin to proactively
address these issues before the end of 2006. The analysis is steeped in
astrological symbolism, referencing concepts like “the Dragon,” “the
Scales,” and specific planetary alignments to support its claims.

<p>
2004-03-10 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a fervent defense of Serguis Nilus’s writings, framing him
as a prophetic voice echoing the historical “Oprichnina” – a period of
ruthless suppression of heresy and dissent within the Russian Orthodox
Church. It argues that Nilus’s work exposes a current crisis within the
Church, where established figures are failing to uphold Orthodox faith,
defend the concept of “Sovereign Authority,” and protect the Russian
people from perceived Jewish influence.

The text draws parallels between Nilus’s situation and that of
historical “Oprichniks,” portraying him as a necessary, albeit harsh,
figure confronting corruption and heresy within the Church. It accuses
high-ranking Church officials of complicity in this corruption,
suggesting they are actively suppressing truth and protecting a “Jewish
conquest” of Russia.

Nilus’s writings are presented as a vital warning, a “prophetic message”
that has become increasingly relevant in the face of contemporary
challenges. The author urges readers to carefully study Nilus’s work,
comparing it to Scripture and current events, and to recognize the
enduring power of God to deliver Russia from its spiritual and political
woes. The text concludes with a call to unwavering faith and obedience
to God, emphasizing the importance of standing firm against deception
and corruption.

“REFORM” Bread
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-03-17 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a critical analysis of Russia’s agricultural situation,
particularly focusing on the factors contributing to a recent bread
crisis. It argues that the current problems stem from a rejection of
Soviet-era agricultural practices and a reliance on a flawed,
market-driven approach. The author traces the issues back to the 1990s,
highlighting the impact of IMF-imposed reforms, the privatization of
land, and a shift towards exporting grain rather than securing domestic
food supplies.

The piece contends that Russia’s agricultural decline is exacerbated by
a lack of investment in the sector and a failure to prioritize food
security. It draws parallels with the pre-revolutionary period,
suggesting that the current situation mirrors the historical reliance on
exporting grain while struggling to feed the population. The author
criticizes the government’s approach, pointing to a reliance on foreign
aid and a disregard for the lessons of the past.

The text emphasizes the need for a strategic shift towards supporting
domestic agricultural production, advocating for increased investment
and a return to practices that prioritize food security. It concludes
with a warning that continued inaction could lead to further instability
and potentially, another revolution.

</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-03-24 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

The text presents a pessimistic assessment of Russia’s political and
economic situation under Vladimir Putin, arguing that his victory in the
2004 elections was largely due to circumstance and a failing opposition,
rather than genuine popular support. Several key arguments are made:

-   **External Factors:** The primary driver of Putin’s success was the
    exhaustion of the Russian public with ineffective elections and the
    absence of a credible alternative.
-   **Manipulation of Opposition:** Putin skillfully manipulated the
    opposition, using tactics like the prosecution of figures like
    General Prosecutor Yuri Skuratov to discredit and neutralize
    potential rivals.
-   **Economic Vulnerabilities:** The reliance on oil revenues and the
    adoption of a neoliberal economic model (driven by the IMF) are seen
    as unsustainable and ultimately detrimental to Russia’s long-term
    development. The text highlights the potential for rising costs of
    utilities and energy, coupled with the influence of foreign powers
    (particularly the US and China), to create significant economic and
    social instability.
-   **Regional Discontent:** The text predicts growing discontent among
    regional leaders and businesses, fueled by Putin’s centralized
    control and the influence of foreign powers.
-   **Imminent Crisis:** The author anticipates a major crisis in
    2004-2005, triggered by the economic and social pressures, and
    foresees a significant shift in political dynamics.

Several commentators offer differing perspectives, with some emphasizing
Putin’s strategic maneuvering and the external pressures he faces, while
others warn of the dangers of his policies and the potential for a
destabilizing crisis. The overall tone is one of concern about Russia’s
trajectory and the potential for a significant political upheaval.

Vladimir Marochkin’s “The Everyday Life of a Russian Rock Musician”
(2003) offers a detailed history of Russian rock music, exploring its
creation, evolution, and the personal lives of musicians. The book
covers band formation and dissolution, songwriting processes, concert
experiences, and leisure activities. It draws comparisons to the Russian
Silver Age and examines the controversial “ghengings” on rock musicians
during the Soviet era. Despite its strengths, the book’s focus on
closely aligned musical groups leads to a limited scope, largely
excluding the Russian rock scene of the 1990s and early 2000s. The
journal “Rockmusic.ru” is presented as a promising new publication,
though it leans towards a left-wing perspective and lacks radical voices

Myth of Russian apathy
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-03-24 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the prevailing political and social
landscape in Russia, arguing against the pervasive myth of Russian
apathy and passivity. The author contends that for decades, a deliberate
narrative has been constructed – the “myth of Russian apathy” – to
justify political stagnation and the dominance of a corrupt, ineffective
elite. This myth, dating back to the post-Soviet era, claims that the
Russian people are inherently unwilling to engage in political activity
or challenge authority.

The author dismantles this myth by highlighting the constant, often
overlooked, activity of the Russian population: from widespread tax
evasion and disregard for intellectual property rights, to spontaneous
protests and acts of civil disobedience. They argue that this activity,
far from being indicative of apathy, demonstrates a deep-seated distrust
of the government and a persistent desire for change.

The core argument is that the myth of apathy is a tool used to maintain
control, allowing the ruling elite to avoid accountability and to
manipulate public opinion. The author expresses frustration with the
superficiality of contemporary political discourse, characterized by
empty rhetoric and a lack of genuine engagement.

Ultimately, the text suggests that the conditions are ripe for a shift
in public sentiment, fueled by a growing disillusionment with the status
quo. It anticipates a potential uprising, not necessarily violent, but
driven by a collective desire for genuine political participation and a
rejection of the manufactured myth of Russian apathy. The author
believes that a leader who can genuinely connect with the people and
articulate their frustrations could trigger a significant change.

The text is a lengthy, critical observation about the decline of
journalistic standards and the broader societal impact of corrupted
information. It argues that a former journalist, now elderly, continues
to publish flawed material due to respect for his past contributions,
creating a situation where a “sick” information diet is being passively
consumed by the public. The author uses the analogy of food – comparing
the consumption of poor quality information to consuming spoiled food,
leading to a spiritual and moral decay. They criticize the lack of
oversight and quality control in media, referencing a specific example
of a former television executive who defended the dominance of a flawed
broadcast channel for his daughter. The text concludes with a call to

spiritual nourishment – through Russian culture, literature, and
patriotic sources – to combat this societal illness and heal themselves.

This text is a nostalgic and deeply felt reflection on the importance of
Russian folk song. It describes the song’s origins, tracing its roots
back to ancient rituals and the connection between humans and nature.
The author emphasizes the song’s role as a repository of history,
emotion, and national identity, particularly highlighting its connection

The text portrays the song as a vital force, intrinsically linked to
human well-being and spiritual connection. It details the diverse forms

pieces – and underscores the specific qualities needed to truly
appreciate and perform Russian folk music: a focused, attentive, and

Ultimately, the text expresses a profound concern about the decline of

2004-04-07 - <b> Aleksey Lapshin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text explores the complex and often contradictory relationship
between postmodernism and globalization. It argues that while
postmodernism, with its emphasis on discourse and deconstruction,
appears to challenge globalization’s drive for universal uniformity –
represented by the “pyramid” structure of globalism – this is a
superficial opposition. The text highlights a fundamental disconnect:
postmodernism’s inherent skepticism and rejection of grand narratives
clashes with globalism’s ambition for a centralized, stable world order.

Key points include the critique of globalism as a rigid, hierarchical
system, contrasted with postmodernism’s valuing of diverse perspectives
and its rejection of “truth.” The text examines the influence of
thinkers like Peter Kozyrevski, Alvin Toffler, and Paul Feyerabend, who
advocated for decentralization and intellectual pluralism. It suggests
that postmodernism, despite its initial intentions, ultimately led to a
form of “nihilism” – a detachment from meaning and a blurring of the
individual subject.

The author contends that globalism, recognizing the limitations of this
approach, is now shifting towards a more conservative stance,
anticipating a fundamental conflict with the postmodern mindset. The
final analysis portrays globalist figures as caricatures, highlighting
the absurdity of the situation and predicting an inevitable collision
between these two opposing forces.

EASTER IS THE NATIONAL IDEA OF RUSSIA
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-04-14 - <b> Aleksandr Prokhanov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a deeply personal and philosophical reflection on Russian
history, identity, and the enduring quest for immortality. It centers
around the idea that Russia’s unique historical trajectory – marked by a
persistent “otherness” or “foreignness” – has been driven by a singular,
almost messianic, goal: to overcome death and create a truly immortal
human race.

The author, deeply influenced by his upbringing and experiences,
believes this “national idea” of Russia is rooted in a combination of
religious belief, historical trauma, and personal experiences, including
witnessing significant events like the construction of the White
Sea-Baltic Canal and the impact of the Soviet era. He emphasizes the
importance of the collective memory of suffering and sacrifice,
particularly the martyrdom of figures like his father, who died fighting
in World War II.

Central to his argument is the concept of a “red project,” a deliberate
attempt to transcend human limitations through technological and
spiritual means. He views the Soviet Union as a flawed but ultimately
purposeful experiment in this endeavor, fueled by a desire to create a
“new Jerusalem” – a place where humanity could achieve immortality. He
connects this project to the biblical story of the resurrection, seeing
it as a continuation of the same fundamental human yearning.

The author’s personal narrative – his childhood experiences, his
relationship with his father, and his encounters with figures like
Nikolai Fedorov – serve as illustrations of this broader philosophical
argument. He believes that Russia’s history is a continuous cycle of
suffering and redemption, culminating in the victory of 1945, which
represents a pivotal moment in the realization of this “national idea.”

Ultimately, the text expresses a profound sense of hope and a belief in
the potential for humanity to overcome its mortality, viewing Russia as
a key player in this transformative process. It’s a passionate, almost
mystical, reflection on the meaning of life, death, and the enduring
human desire for transcendence.

This text explores the significance of Easter, particularly within a
Russian context, as a central theme of overcoming death and embracing a
challenging, transformative existence. It frames Easter not as a passive
religious observance, but as a call to confront and ultimately conquer
the “death” – both literal and metaphorical – inherent in human

journey, involving a “crucifixion” and subsequent “resurrection,”
representing a struggle against a modern world that denies this
fundamental truth. It emphasizes a proactive, even rebellious, approach
to life, advocating for bold action, unconventional solutions, and a
willingness to engage with negativity to achieve a higher state of
being. The Russian Easter is presented as a struggle, a “battle” against
a hostile world, and a journey towards a “Great Day” – a victory
achieved through defiance and a rejection of established norms.

This text is a reflective and somewhat melancholic reminiscence about a
meeting with the writer and poet, Sergei Mikhalkov, in post-Soviet
Germany. It explores themes of legacy, honor, and the changing
perception of historical figures. The narrator recounts a chance
encounter with Mikhalkov, a man deeply ingrained in the collective
memory of Russia, particularly as “дядя Степа” – a beloved, almost
mythical figure. The narrative contrasts Mikhalkov’s enduring,
uncomplicated goodness with the narrator’s own anxieties about the
passage of time, the loss of ideals, and the fading relevance of
historical figures. It’s a meditation on how people are remembered and
the comfort found in familiar, uncomplicated figures of the past,
particularly when faced with uncertainty and change. The encounter
highlights the importance of simple kindness and genuine connection, and
the narrator’s own struggle to reconcile his present with the idealized
image of Mikhalkov.

FIRE RESISTANCE

<p>

The article details the tumultuous and protracted conflict in Iraq,
beginning with the 2003 invasion and subsequent resistance. Initially,
the invasion faced stiff, unexpected Iraqi resistance, leading to
significant coalition casualties and a prolonged, confusing war. The
early phases involved heavy bombing, street-to-street fighting, and the
emergence of a “friendly fire” problem. Despite the coalition’s initial
goals, including the search for weapons of mass destruction and the
capture of Saddam Hussein, these efforts proved largely unsuccessful.
The conflict evolved into a protracted insurgency, characterized by
guerilla warfare, attacks on coalition forces, and the rise of prominent
figures like Muqtada al-Sadr and his Shia militias.

Over time, the war became increasingly defined by sectarian violence and
the growing influence of extremist groups. The search for WMDs and
Hussein became secondary to the broader struggle against occupation. The
article highlights the mounting casualties on both sides, the difficulty
in establishing control, and the eventual collapse of the Iraqi army.

Ultimately, the conflict concluded with the declaration of victory in
May 2003, but the underlying instability and resistance continued for
years, marked by escalating violence, the capture of key figures like
Saddam Hussein, and the eventual rise of a new insurgency led by
al-Sadr. The article emphasizes the shifting nature of the conflict,
from a conventional military operation to a complex and deeply rooted
insurgency, and the significant human and financial costs of the war.

</p>
<p>

The text is a passionate review of Peter Buslaev’s film “Bumer,” arguing
it’s a profoundly realistic and culturally significant work reflecting
the harsh realities of contemporary Russia. It frames the film as a
condemnation of systemic failings and a portrayal of a “nizovye”
(underworld) Russia where individuals are driven by survival and lacking
any overarching purpose.

The reviewer emphasizes the film’s unflinching depiction of violence,
criminality, and the desperation of marginalized youth, contrasting it
with the sanitized narratives of films like “The Brotherhood.” He sees
“Bumer” as a product of a generation disillusioned with the established
order, mirroring the sentiments expressed in Eduard Limonov’s “In
Prison.”

The film’s realism is highlighted through its depiction of corrupt
police, ruthless criminals, and the cyclical nature of violence. The
reviewer admires the film’s open-endedness and its ability to resonate
with a generation grappling with a lack of opportunity and a broken
system. He celebrates “Bumer” as a pivotal moment in Russian cinema, a
new wave of filmmakers challenging established norms and striving to
capture the essence of contemporary Russian life, urging other Russian
writers to learn from this new generation.

This lengthy text is a rambling, satirical critique of nationalism,

manipulated and influenced by external factors like technology, economic
trends (particularly beer and mineral water), and global competition. It
highlights a cyclical pattern of nationalistic fervor, often fueled by
perceived economic or technological disadvantages, and criticizes the
superficiality of national pride. The piece ultimately suggests that
genuine progress lies in developing self-sufficient,

2004-05-26 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text presents a critical analysis of Russia’s current situation,
arguing it’s shaped by a deliberate effort by Western powers to
destabilize the country and ultimately control its resources. It frames
Russia’s challenges as stemming from a global power struggle,
particularly concerning access to and control of natural resources,
specifically energy.

The core argument is that Western actors, including the IMF, the US
Federal Reserve, and organizations like the Globalist, are actively
working to undermine Russia’s economic and political stability. This is
achieved through various means, including manipulating the economy,
promoting social unrest, and attempting to dismantle Russia’s national
identity and sovereignty.

The text highlights a long-standing historical pattern: Western powers,
driven by a belief in limitless growth and consumption, seek to exploit
Russia’s vast resources. It draws on historical precedents, referencing
the early 20th-century ideas of the Rothschild family regarding global
resource management and the concept of a “global community” with shared
responsibility for resource allocation.

The analysis suggests that Western powers are attempting to create a
long-term crisis in Russia, aiming to force the country to accept
conditions that would allow them to exert greater control over its
economy and political system. The text emphasizes a strategic
competition for global influence, with Russia viewed as a key obstacle
to Western dominance. It concludes with a cautiously optimistic outlook,
suggesting that Russia’s current challenges could ultimately lead to a
more stable and self-reliant nation, provided the government continues
to pursue a course of modernization and strengthen national identity.

    This text details a pivotal moment in Venezuelan politics – the
    “Battle of Santa Ines,” a staged referendum orchestrated by
    President Hugo Chávez to discredit the opposition and solidify his
    power. Chávez, recognizing the failure of previous coup attempts,
    devised a plan to use a referendum not to remove him, but to
    dismantle the opposition by falsely portraying them as corrupt and
    lacking support.

The referendum itself was a manipulation, designed to create the
illusion of widespread opposition support. Chávez employed tactics like
bribery, intimidation, and even deceased individuals’ signatures to
achieve his goal. However, the situation quickly spiraled out of control
as Chávez’s supporters, fueled by paranoia and a desire to purge the
revolution of perceived “enemies,” engaged in increasingly aggressive
actions, including attacks on protestors, vandalism, and even violence.

The event was characterized by a chaotic and ultimately unsuccessful
attempt to demonstrate Chávez’s dominance. It involved a massive,
largely uncoordinated mobilization of Chávez supporters, who engaged in
increasingly erratic and violent behavior, attempting to intimidate and
discredit the opposition. The entire affair was marked by a sense of
manufactured crisis and paranoia, highlighting the deep divisions and

“Battle of Santa Ines” was a strategic miscalculation by Chávez,

This text is a scathing critique of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and the
ideology surrounding it. It argues that Putin’s regime is a carefully
constructed facade, a “mummy” built from the corpses of Russia’s past –
Tsarist, Soviet, and liberal eras. The author uses vivid, often
grotesque imagery to portray this ideology as a destructive force,
actively suppressing genuine creativity, historical memory, and
revolutionary spirit.

The core argument is that Putin’s government is deliberately attempting
to erase the positive aspects of Russia’s past, particularly the “red
era,” and replace them with a sterile, controlling narrative. This is
achieved through a systematic campaign of disinformation, manipulation,
and the suppression of dissenting voices, exemplified by the relentless
attacks on the Communist Party.

The author proposes a radical solution: to involve the impoverished and
disenfranchised – specifically, the “hungry miners” – as delegates to
the Communist Party Congress, recognizing their potential as a genuine
embodiment of the revolutionary spirit. The text ultimately calls for a
return to a “creative, ‘fiery’ ideology,” rooted in the collective will

parliamentarians, framed as a political protest against President
Lukashenko. The individuals – a businessman, a general, and an Olympic
champion – are attempting to draw attention to a perceived impending
constitutional coup and pressure for Lukashenko’s resignation.

This isn’t the first time Belarusian opposition figures have used hunger
strikes as a tactic. A similar, earlier protest in 1995, involving
radical nationalist groups, was dismissed as a cheap political stunt.
The current strikers are portrayed as “clean lambs” compared to their

The text suggests widespread skepticism among the Belarusian public
regarding the strikers’ motives, with many viewing their actions as
another cynical political performance. The timing of the strike, ahead

the group’s genuine intentions and whether they are simply attempting to

The reviewer critiques Wolfgang Petersen’s “Troy” for its surprisingly
sophisticated and ideologically driven interpretation of the Trojan War.
The film deviates significantly from Homer’s epic, employing later Greek
and Roman literary sources, particularly “The Aeneid,” to portray the
Trojans and barbarians in a sympathetic light. The director subverts
traditional heroic narratives by depicting the Trojans as devout and
courageous, contrasting them with the hubris and flaws of the Greek
heroes. Furthermore, the film’s release coincided with broader cultural

This text is a scathing critique of Russia’s vulnerability to foreign
influence, particularly through trade and economic policies. It argues
that Russia has been systematically exploited by external forces, both
intentionally and unintentionally. The author details how Russia’s
agricultural sector has been decimated, its industries weakened, and its
consumer market flooded with inferior goods – essentially a “dumping” of
unwanted products.

The core argument is that Russia’s openness to foreign goods, driven by
misguided economic theories and a lack of national self-sufficiency, has
led to a loss of control over its own economy and culture. The text
highlights a historical pattern of external manipulation, referencing
figures like Shmelev, who embodies the dangerous allure of easy credit
and foreign investment.

Ultimately, the piece expresses a deep concern about Russia’s national
identity and warns against the dangers of unchecked foreign influence,
advocating for a return to self-reliance and a careful selection of
imports. It paints a picture of Russia as a victim, deliberately
weakened by external forces.

The text describes a manufactured financial crisis in Russia, fueled by
orchestrated panic and disinformation. It argues that the crisis isn’t
primarily due to bank failures but rather a deliberate attempt to
destabilize the country by manipulating public fear. The narrative
centers on a coordinated effort to discredit the government,
particularly through the actions of figures within the Central Bank and
the manipulation of public perception. The crisis is portrayed as a
power struggle between the government and wealthy oligarchs, with the
goal of undermining the existing elite. The author suggests that the
crisis is a result of a lack of a strong national ideology, a clear
project, and social mobility within the government, making it vulnerable
to manipulation. The orchestrated panic, driven by PR campaigns and the
actions of individuals like Stanislav Belkovsky, is presented as the
core issue, rather than genuine bank failures.

CHINESE QUESTION FOR RUSSIA
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-07-21 - <b> Andrey Devyatov </b>
</p>
<p>

The text outlines a complex geopolitical analysis focusing on the rising
influence of China and its implications for Russia. It posits that China
is undergoing a period of rapid economic growth and expansion, driven by
a desire for resource security and global influence. This expansion is
characterized by strategic acquisitions of resources and infrastructure
across Asia, particularly in countries bordering Russia.

The analysis highlights a growing rivalry between Russia and China,
fueled by competition for resources and strategic positioning. China’s
“New Silk Road” initiative, aimed at securing access to energy and raw
materials, is seen as a direct challenge to Russia’s traditional role as
a major supplier.

The text suggests that Russia needs to adapt to this changing landscape,
viewing China’s rise not just as a threat but also as an opportunity. It
proposes innovative strategies, such as developing synthetic fuel
production in northeastern Russia and utilizing the Port of Troupe to
facilitate trade with China, as ways to leverage China’s ambitions while
safeguarding Russia’s interests. The author emphasizes the importance of
a strategic shift in mindset, recognizing the need to absorb and
redirect the energy of China’s expansion to benefit Russia. Finally, the
text warns of potential conflict arising from competing interests on the
Russian Far East and Central Asia.

Odoevo and its surrounding areas. The author, a journalist, explores the
region’s history, particularly its connection to World War II, and
encounters several key figures who shaped its past. He visits the homes
and legacies of individuals like Anna and Ilya Puzakov, who offer a
window into the lives of “great Russians” and the evolving perceptions
of this identity. He also meets Evdokiya Svet-Fedorovna, a revered
school director and educator who was a prominent figure in the region’s
history and a recipient of numerous national awards. Throughout his
travels, the author examines the shifting narratives surrounding Russian
identity, particularly the changing attitudes towards the “great

“petlyakov loop” of military strategy. He highlights the importance of
local memory and the preservation of historical figures and
institutions, such as the Odoevo museum and school, as tangible links to

Vyatcheslav Shcherov recounts his lifelong dedication to preserving and
studying authentic, ancient Russian folk songs. Initially, he and his
colleagues at the Main Music Editing Department of the Soviet State
Radio and Television (GOLRADIO) were critical of traditional songs,
deeming them “disharmonious” and “wild,” preferring to promote
“quasi-folk” choirs. However, he and his students, including Irina
Nabotova, began actively collecting songs from rural areas, often
through expeditions and collaborations with local enthusiasts.

Over time, Shcherov established a network of folk song collectives
across Russia, many of which originated from rural areas and were led by
individuals like Nabotova and others connected to churches and schools.
These collectives, ranging from established groups like “Krasnaya Gorka”
in Bryansk to younger groups in cities like Irkutsk and Korsakov,
continue to perform and collect traditional songs, creating a cyclical
process of rural tradition meeting urban preservation. Shcherov
emphasizes the importance of these groups, noting that many of their
members’ roots lie in rural areas, and that the continued vitality of
Russian folk music depends on the dedication of these groups and their
ongoing efforts to keep the tradition alive.

A wave of protests has emerged in Russia, fueled by a controversial law
eliminating social benefits and involving a broad coalition of groups
including nationalists, communists, veterans, students, and youth
activists. Initially sparked by national-bolsheviks storming the
Ministry of Health and Social Development and discarding portraits of
Putin and government officials, the protests have escalated with actions
like protracted hunger strikes and arrests. Authorities responded with
heavy-handed tactics, including arrests, fines, and charges under
Article 213 of the Criminal Code (hooliganism with weapons), leading to
significant repression and accusations of politically motivated
persecution. The scale of the arrests and the legal framing of the
protesters’ actions highlight a perceived escalation of state control

<p>

This text is a collection of excerpts from several Russian-language
journals, all united by a specific ideological stance. The core theme is
a critique of contemporary Western culture and a defense of traditional
values, particularly those rooted in Russian history and Orthodox
Christianity. The journals – “Ultima Thule,” “Athenae,” “Russian Will,”
and “European Citizen” – present themselves as resisting a perceived
“Fourth World War” waged through new technologies and intellectual
manipulation.

They advocate for a return to “archeo-futurism,” a synthesis of ancient
wisdom and future possibilities, and identify themselves as “partisans”
fighting against a globalist “occupation.” They frequently reference
figures like René Guénon, Dmitry NeSterov, and Juan Carlos Mariéguella,
and engage in polemical debates with liberal and “leftist” viewpoints. A
key element is the belief in a unique Russian destiny – the idea of
Russia as “Ultima Thule” – a final, transcendent point of reference. The
journals emphasize a rejection of modern, secular trends and a
commitment to preserving traditional Russian identity, often through a
neo-pagan or Rodnoverie (Slavic paganism) lens. They present themselves
as defenders of “tradition” against a perceived onslaught of “cultural
Marxism” and globalist forces.

Unthankfulness

</p>
<p>

This text details a complex and troubling situation involving a conflict
between a group of Orthodox parishioners led by Father Alexander
Saltykov and the staff of the All-Russian Scientific-Restoration Center
named after Grabary. The center, established in 1918 and historically
reliant on state-provided buildings (including former churches), houses
a significant collection of Russian art and religious artifacts.

The core of the issue revolves around a takeover of the Grabary Center’s
workshops by a group of young men, seemingly orchestrated to seize
control of the space and its contents. This action is framed as a
deliberate provocation, potentially fueled by a desire to disrupt the
work of the center and create discord within the Russian cultural and
religious communities.

Several factors contribute to the escalating tension: the center’s
precarious position as a “state orphan,” the historical reliance on
repurposed church buildings, and a perceived lack of support from
government officials, exemplified by the detached response of the head
of the Federal Archival Administration, Mikhail Shvyddyko.

The situation highlights concerns about the vulnerability of cultural
institutions, the potential for conflict between religious groups and
preservation efforts, and the broader implications for the safeguarding
of Russia’s artistic and historical heritage. The text suggests a
possible conspiracy involving local business interests and a deliberate
attempt to destabilize a vital cultural organization.

<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the recent mayoral elections in
Vladivostok, arguing they were not a genuine democratic process but
rather a carefully orchestrated “special operation” designed to seize
power. The author contends that the election was a staged event,
resembling the 1917 revolution, where a candidate (Vladimir Nikolaev)
was installed through manipulation and deception.

Key points of the analysis include: the involvement of shadowy figures
and “special operations,” the manipulation of local institutions like
the election commission (headed by a young, seemingly naive girl named
Tanya), and the suppression of genuine opposition. The author highlights
the lack of real voter engagement, suggesting that most voters were
simply participating in a ritual designed to legitimize a pre-determined
outcome.

The piece argues that the election was a symptom of a broader problem
within Russian politics – a weakening of state control and a willingness
to use covert operations to achieve political goals. The author
expresses skepticism about the legitimacy of the election results and
questions the motivations of those involved, suggesting a deliberate
attempt to destabilize and control the political landscape. Ultimately,

The text discusses the current state of the Catholic Church,
particularly its relationship with Russia and the potential for a new

American influence within the Vatican and the ongoing tensions between
the Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church. A recent attempt to
leverage the return of the icon of the Mother of God, Kazan Icon, to
boost papal influence in Russia, was revealed to be a copy, not the
original. The Russian Orthodox Church is preparing for an Archpastoral
Council to assess its work and future direction, including discussions
on demographics, family values, and the preservation of life. The text
argues that the relationship between the Moscow Patriarchate and the
state is asymmetrical, with the state yielding when it suits it, and
that the Church is increasingly aligned with state initiatives, even
those deemed anti-Christian. Concerns are raised about the Church’s
active role in elections and its willingness to support state policies,

This text argues that Russia’s economic “boom” is a deliberate
manipulation by a liberal bureaucratic elite, prioritizing statistical
targets like GDP growth over genuine improvements in the country’s
well-being and long-term prospects. The primary goal isn’t economic
development but achieving a predetermined 2010 GDP target, masking a
deeper trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a few, exacerbating
inequality, and neglecting critical issues like declining life
expectancy, technological stagnation, and the erosion of social safety
nets.

The author criticizes the government’s focus on “market infrastructure”
– essentially dismantling social protections – and its disregard for the
needs of the population. The core argument is that this policy, driven
by figures like Yegor Gaidar, is fundamentally unsustainable, leading to
a cash-out of capital by wealthy owners, a decline in key industries,
and ultimately, a crisis.

The text calls for a fundamental shift in leadership, arguing that the
current liberal bureaucracy is incapable of addressing the challenges
and that a new generation of leaders is needed to prioritize genuine
economic and social development rather than simply meeting pre-set,
misleading statistical goals. The author predicts a coming crisis due to
infrastructure decay, technological decline, and capital flight,

in defense spending compared to the previous year. A substantial portion
of revenue (around 20%) will be channeled into the Stabilization Fund,
primarily to improve the sovereign credit rating of Russian companies.
Regional budgets will be further strained as they absorb additional
expenses related to a recent “benefits reform,” alongside rising energy
and commodity prices. This prioritization of defense and credit ratings
is criticized as detrimental to the Russian population, with increased
burdens on citizens and reduced tax rates for major corporations.

2004-10-06 - <b> Aleksandr Velisov </b>
</p>
<p>
This text discusses the ongoing tensions surrounding North Korea’s
nuclear program, particularly the construction of a nuclear reactor at
Yongbyon. It highlights the perceived double standards applied to North
Korea compared to Israel’s nuclear capabilities, and criticizes the
international community’s approach, arguing it’s fueled by hysteria and
misinformation. The article details the potential threat posed by North
Korea’s ability to deploy “dirty bombs” – conventional weapons filled
with radioactive materials – capable of inflicting significant damage
and disruption. It emphasizes the lack of security guarantees offered by
the United States and the potential for a devastating conflict in the
region. The core argument is that the situation is a “global
organizational, diplomatic, and economic bomb” and that a non-aggression
pact between North Korea and the United States is the only realistic
solution to de-escalate the crisis.

This text is a deeply personal and reflective account from a Russian
writer about his lifelong love of Leo Tolstoy and his frequent visits to
Yasnaya Polyana, Tolstoy’s estate. The writer expresses a profound
connection to Tolstoy’s work, particularly “Two Hussars,” and emphasizes
the importance of compassion and empathy, qualities he feels are lacking
in contemporary literature. He recounts numerous encounters with
Tolstoy’s relatives, including Tatiana Nikolaevna, and details receiving
the “Yasnaya Polyana” prize for his story “Autumn in Taman,”
highlighting the need for Tolstoy’s values – love and compassion – to be
reflected in modern writing. The writer views Tolstoy as a multi-faceted
artist and stresses the enduring relevance of his works, especially his
later folk stories, which he believes offer a vital antidote to the
current state of Russia.

SCAL OF TERROR
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-10-20 - <b> Nikolay Mikhaylov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text expresses deep frustration and suspicion regarding the Russian
government’s response to terrorism, particularly in Chechnya. The author
argues that the government’s actions are inadequate and, in some cases,
actively contribute to the problem. Key points include:

-   **Ineffective Response:** The author criticizes the government’s
    lack of decisive action, citing examples like the failure to
    properly address terrorist financing, investigate the root causes of
    violence, or effectively combat the underlying conditions that
    foster extremism.
-   **Corruption and Complicity:** The text accuses powerful figures
    within the Russian government and economy of facilitating terrorism
    by turning a blind eye to illicit financial activities and profiting
    from the chaos.
-   **Misdirection of Resources:** The author argues that significant
    funds intended for reconstruction and security are being diverted to
    enrich corrupt officials and support terrorist operations.
-   **Lack of Transparency:** The author expresses concern about the
    secrecy surrounding intelligence operations and the failure of
    security services to identify and disrupt terrorist networks.
-   **Root Cause of Terrorism:** The author suggests that the
    government’s policies and corruption are the primary drivers of
    terrorism, rather than external threats.

Essentially, the text portrays a situation where the government is not
genuinely combating terrorism but is instead enabling it through
negligence, corruption, and a deliberate lack of accountability.

<p>
The text expresses a growing concern about extremist Islamic sentiment
within Europe, fueled by perceived injustices like the US actions in
Iraq and Palestine. It describes a rise in anti-Western rhetoric,
particularly within mosques and Islamic centers, where speakers advocate
for a global Islamic caliphate and openly express admiration for figures
like Osama bin Laden. These views are linked to a sense of European
disillusionment with Western values and a belief that Europe is being
manipulated by a corrupt elite. The text highlights the difficulty of
combating these extremist ideas due to legal protections for religious
expression and the presence of these views within public spaces. It
suggests that the roots of this extremism lie within Europe itself,
stemming from a dissatisfaction with Western ideals and a desire for a
radical transformation.

This text presents a critical and accusatory narrative alleging
widespread corruption, collusion, and systemic bias within Moscow’s

It details numerous instances of alleged favoritism, including
preferential treatment in registration, property ownership, and police

Chechen influence within key sectors like real estate, construction, and

connections to prominent figures such as Yevgeny Лужков. It suggests a

Why is gasoline getting more expensive?
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-10-20 - <b> Mikhail Khazin </b>
</p>
<p>
This text argues that the rising price of gasoline is primarily driven
by speculative financial activity rather than supply and demand
dynamics. The author contends that a significant portion of global
speculative money is flowing into oil futures due to economic weakness
in the United States – specifically, a declining economy, large budget
deficits, and a weakening dollar. This influx is artificially inflating
oil prices, benefiting Russian oil companies who are exporting heavily
despite assurances to the US that they won’t reduce exports.
Furthermore, the author suggests that Russian oil companies are
deliberately hindering investment in domestic industries to ensure
continued high oil exports. Finally, the author predicts that when the
“bubble” of high oil prices bursts, Russia will be left with limited
investment and a stabilized, but ultimately unsustainable, economic
situation, potentially leading to gasoline prices similar to those in
Europe, achieved through a deliberate policy of suppressing domestic
industry to maintain high oil exports.

<h3>
Philosophy of Part Memory by Jacques Derrida
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-10-27 - <b> Andrey Smirnov </b>
</p>
<p>
Jacques Derrida, a prominent 20th-century philosopher, significantly
impacted contemporary culture through his work, particularly “Of
Grammatology” and “Writing and Difference.” His philosophy challenged
traditional European thought, rejecting the idea of a fixed, unified
“logos” and instead focusing on “differentials” or “différances.”
Derrida questioned the privileged status of alphabetic writing and
emphasized the role of “voice” – the presence of the “self” – in
philosophical discourse. He employed a deconstructive method, rejecting
historical linear approaches and aiming to expose the open, unstable
nature of meaning. Despite his intellectual contributions, Derrida’s
philosophical stances sometimes diverged from his social activism, as
evidenced by his involvement in a controversial letter against
“national- Bolshevik conspiracy” in France. His work, often
characterized as a “philosophy of parts” or “multiplied world,” has been
subject to its own deconstruction, reflecting the evolving intellectual
landscape of the 21st century.

The text is a scathing critique of poet Evgeny Yevtushenko’s response to
the Beslan tragedy. It argues that Yevtushenko’s actions – publishing
his poetry in a liberal publication and advocating for universal
forgiveness – are disingenuous and morally compromised. The author
accuses Yevtushenko of essentially legitimizing Chechen violence and
justifying the deaths of Russian and Ossetian children. He argues that
Yevtushenko’s stance is driven by political opportunism, echoing a
history of Russian intellectuals appeasing autocratic regimes. The text
uses sarcasm and historical parallels (Stalin’s expulsion of Chechens,
the 1905 defeat, etc.) to highlight what it perceives as Yevtushenko’s
hypocrisy and a dangerous attempt to erase the specific context of the
tragedy and the responsibility of the perpetrators. Ultimately, the
author rejects Yevtushenko’s call for universal forgiveness, asserting
that the victims, particularly the Russian and Ossetian children,
deserve justice and accountability.

CHOSEN WOMAN BY THE PRESIDENT
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-11-03 - <b> Stanislav Belkovskiy </b>
</p>
<p>

This lengthy text is a satirical and cynical commentary on Vladimir
Putin’s potential long-term rule in Russia, framed as a conversation
between a “Liberal” and a man named “Kapitolina Ivanovna,” a wealthy,
aging, and eccentric former wife of a high-ranking official. The core
argument is that Putin’s ambition to consolidate power and establish a
permanent, authoritarian regime is fundamentally flawed and based on a
delusional understanding of history and human nature.

Kapitolina Ivanovna, representing a decaying, entrenched elite, believes
Putin will inevitably seek to establish a perpetual dictatorship, much
like past empires. She sees herself as a historical archetype – a
powerful, controlling woman who will manipulate events to maintain her
dominance. The text mocks the idea of liberal reforms as simply a tool
for this elite to further their own ambitions.

The author uses a darkly humorous tone, filled with exaggeration and
historical references, to critique the perceived stagnation of Russian
society and the cyclical nature of power struggles. The text suggests
that Russia’s history is marked by periods of decline and decay, and
that attempts to modernize or reform the country are ultimately futile.
It concludes with a bleak assessment of Russia’s future, suggesting that
the country is destined to continue its downward spiral.

This lengthy article, written in 2004, analyzes the highly contested
Ukrainian presidential election and predicts a likely outcome: a
negotiated settlement rather than a decisive victory for either Viktor
Yushchenko or Viktor Yanukovych. The author argues that both candidates,
backed by powerful external influences (primarily the US and Russia),
are essentially pawns in a larger geopolitical game.

The article highlights the strategic maneuvering and “fake war” tactics
employed by both camps – including staged demonstrations, disinformation
campaigns, and even the attempted poisoning of Yushchenko. It emphasizes
the importance of maintaining stability within Ukraine, suggesting that
a compromise is the most probable outcome.

Crucially, the piece predicts a shift towards parliamentary elections if
the US fails to resolve its internal political disputes, suggesting that
the election’s true significance lies in its potential to destabilize
Ukraine and influence the broader geopolitical landscape. It dismisses
the idea of a clear-cut winner and frames the entire process as a
carefully orchestrated “game” with significant external players. The
article also critiques the involvement of foreign political consultants
and highlights the manipulative tactics employed by both sides,
ultimately predicting a drawn-out and unstable political situation.

The text recounts the story of Sladgorod, a small Russian town, and its
turbulent history centered around a former mayor, Alexander Gelmel.
Decades prior, Gelmel, along with meatpacker Henrik Kaiser, instigated a
period of economic hardship and corruption, exploiting local businesses
and residents. Kaiser’s murder, orchestrated by someone seeking to
eliminate a powerful opponent, deeply affected the town. Gelmel,
capitalizing on the chaos, rose to power, continuing a pattern of

leveraging the town’s vulnerability and nostalgia. The narrative
highlights a cycle of corruption, economic decline, and the town’s
susceptibility to manipulation, portraying Gelmel as a recurring figure

</p>
<p>

This text details the history of the Novoyeraslim Monastery, founded by
Patriarch Nikon in the 17th century as a deliberate recreation of
Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Nikon’s creation wasn’t simply a building
project; it was a carefully constructed “topographical icon,” mirroring
the spatial relationships of the original sites. The monastery’s layout,
with its named locations mirroring those in Palestine (Jordan, Favor,
Eleon, etc.), was intended to evoke a spiritual connection to the
biblical lands.

The project’s success, despite periods of destruction and upheaval –
including the monastery’s eventual dismantling during the Russian Civil
War – highlights a recurring theme: the cyclical nature of creation and
destruction, mirroring the history of Jerusalem itself. Nikon’s vision
was ultimately embraced by God, and the restoration efforts following
the war demonstrate a renewed commitment to this “topographical icon.”
The text emphasizes that the monastery’s significance lies not just in
its physical structure, but in its symbolic representation of faith and
the enduring connection to the Holy Land. The ongoing restoration
efforts are seen as a continuation of this original, divinely-inspired
project.

This text presents a bleak and alarming vision of the future, arguing
that humanity is rapidly sliding into a state of profound spiritual and
cultural decay driven by widespread drug use and the manipulation of
mass media. The author contends that a powerful, unseen force –
symbolized by the proliferation of addictive substances and the erosion
of traditional values – is systematically dismantling society.

Key arguments include the increasing prevalence of drug use,
particularly among young people, fueled by the allure of mass media and
the availability of potent narcotics. The author critiques the rise of
“postmodern” art and culture, characterized by nihilism, hallucinogenic
experiences, and a rejection of traditional values. He expresses concern
over the influence of computers and the internet, portraying them as
tools for manipulation and the spread of harmful ideas.

The text warns of a future dominated by a mass of drug-addicted,
“animalistic” humanoids, controlled by powerful elites. It calls for a
spiritual and cultural revolution, urging individuals to reject harmful
influences and return to traditional Christian values as a means of
combating this impending collapse. The author paints a picture of a

deliberate strategy by President Putin to withdraw from the Ukrainian
crisis, orchestrated by American architects of the “Orange Revolution,”
utilizing scenarios like “Korsik” and “Nord-Ost.” The narrative suggests
a plan to destabilize Russia through terrorist attacks targeting nuclear

This text details the significant Russian involvement in Persia
(modern-day Iran) during World War I, specifically focusing on the
“Kavkaz Corps” (Caucasus Corps) and its interactions with the Iranian
population, particularly the Kurds and the Ardelean dynasty. The Corps,
led by General Baratov, was initially tasked with securing Persia’s
strategic locations and ultimately, establishing a strong alliance with
the local population.

The narrative highlights several key events: the successful capture of
Kermanshah and the surrounding areas, the establishment of a
Russo-Kurdish alliance formalized through a large tribal gathering in
1917, and the crucial role played by Colonel Zaharchenko in fostering
this alliance. Zaharchenko, a skilled diplomat and intelligence officer,
skillfully negotiated with various Kurdish tribes, securing their
support and even organizing a large-scale tribal meeting to solidify the
alliance.

The text emphasizes the cultural significance of the “Gowand” dance, a
traditional Kurdish dance, as a symbol of friendship and unity between
the Russians and the Kurds. It also recounts the historical context of
the Ardelean dynasty and the restoration of the Ardelean prince as a
figurehead of the Kurdish nation.

Ultimately, the text portrays the Kavkaz Corps not just as a military
force, but as a catalyst for forging a lasting relationship between
Russia and the Kurds, a relationship that was cemented through
diplomacy, cultural exchange, and mutual support. It underscores the
strategic importance of Persia and the pivotal role played by Russian
forces in shaping the region’s political landscape during WWI.

Ukraine, portraying it as a key battleground between Russia, the United
States, and Europe. It argues that Ukraine’s election results represent
a significant shift, creating a “balkanization” of the country and
triggering a broader strategic game.

The core argument is that Russia views Ukraine as a “red line,”

driven by concerns about Russian power and access to energy resources,
actively supported the pro-Western candidate, Viktor Yushchenko.

The text suggests a pessimistic outlook, predicting a potential

deep cynicism and disillusionment, portraying Russia as trapped in a
cycle of betrayal, manipulation, and ultimately, a state of perpetual

The author uses vivid, often grotesque imagery – references to a

From “The Empire of Evil” – to “The Empire of Death”
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2004-12-29 - <b> Aleksandr Savin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text analyzes the shift in Russian political discourse,
specifically the emergence of the concept of “liberal imperialism”
promoted by figures like Leonid Gozman and the “Right Power” coalition.
It argues that this shift represents a pragmatic adaptation to Russia’s
geopolitical and economic circumstances, rather than a genuine
ideological commitment.

Initially, the “liberal empire” concept was presented as a pre-election
tactic to appeal to nationalist sentiment (“a desire for the
Fatherland”). However, with the rise of Russia’s economic power and the
unfolding “color revolutions” in neighboring countries, the concept
evolved.

The core argument is that Russia is being positioned as a junior partner
to the United States in a global “liberal imperial” project, essentially
serving as “cannon fodder” for US geopolitical ambitions. This involves
participating in conflicts like the Iraq War and potentially expanding
into regions like the Caucasus, despite the inherent risks of
exacerbating ethnic and religious tensions within Russia itself.

The text suggests that this shift is driven by a desire to maintain
influence on the world stage and leverage Russia’s economic strength,
even if it means accepting a subordinate role within a US-led global
order. It highlights a cynical calculation where Russia’s security and
stability are secondary to the broader strategic goals of the United
States. The author views this as a dangerous trend, potentially leading
to increased instability and conflict within Russia and the surrounding
region.

Evgenia Gutseva’s life was marked by a profound spiritual awakening
through her connection with Orthodox Christianity. Initially a somewhat
lost and seeking woman, she found solace and a creative outlet through
prayer and contemplation in monasteries, leading to a poetic outpouring
of Psalms and devotional works. A pivotal moment occurred when Christ
wept in her home, revealing a deeper understanding of God’s creation and
humanity’s role within it.

Driven by a desire to connect her community to its roots and promote
spiritual values, she spearheaded several projects, including
establishing an ethnographic museum in Klimovsk and, most significantly,
building a small Orthodox chapel near a pond in Gorilov. This
undertaking, initially fraught with bureaucratic obstacles and financial
challenges, ultimately brought the community together, demonstrating the
power of faith and selfless service.

Throughout her endeavors, Gutseva’s faith was strengthened by the
support of the local priest, Father Vladimir, and the generosity of her
