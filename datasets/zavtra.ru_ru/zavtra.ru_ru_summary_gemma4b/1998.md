1998-01-06 - <b> Aleksandr Anisimov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the Russian government’s economic
policies, particularly the 1998 de-denominization of the ruble. The
author argues that the de-denominization was a poorly conceived and
executed measure, driven by short-sighted political considerations
rather than sound economic strategy. He contends that the reforms,
including the rapid dismantling of state assets and the “liberalization”
of the economy, have led to a catastrophic decline in the Russian
economy, with GDP plummeting and the country falling behind other
nations.

The author criticizes the government’s failure to establish a proper
market economy, highlighting the lack of a functioning stock market and
a robust credit system. He argues that the de-denominization, similar to
attempts in other countries, will likely exacerbate inflation and
further damage the Russian financial system.

The author advocates for delaying the de-denominization, focusing
instead on addressing the underlying financial crisis and restoring
confidence in the ruble. He suggests implementing measures to mitigate
the negative effects of the de-denominization, such as a phased rollout
and guarantees for bank deposits. Ultimately, the author believes the
government’s actions have been misguided and will only deepen Russia’s
economic woes.

This text details a complex and troubling situation surrounding the
privatization and subsequent attempted takeover of the “Kubanskiy Gipsk”
gypsum factory in Psebay, Russia, by the German company “Knauf” and its
representative, Kol. The story unfolds through several key events and
accusations:

Initially, after the German reunification, German business interests
aggressively expanded into the former Soviet Union. In 1992, the
factory, a major producer of gypsum, was privatized and transformed into
“Kubanskiy Gipsk.” However, “Knauf” quickly acquired 50% of the shares,
followed by the installation of outdated, overpriced equipment.

The central conflict arises when Kol, representing “Knauf,” orchestrates
a staged “attack” on the factory in September 1997, using armed
ex-military personnel to seize control. This was allegedly done to
pressure the Russian government and exploit perceived injustices related
to the privatization process. The situation escalated into a tense
standoff involving local residents, Cossacks, and the factory’s
management.

Several parties were implicated: Dmitry Vasiliev (head of the Federal
Commission on the Securities Market), Yevgeny Chernomyrdin (former Prime
Minister), and Kol himself. The text suggests a deliberate manipulation
of the situation by these figures to benefit “Knauf.”

The author proposes two solutions: either formally transferring 64% of
the shares to the state or, due to the provocation and damage caused,
nationalizing the factory, refusing to compensate “Knauf” for their
share. The author emphasizes the importance of protecting Russian
industry and preventing exploitation by foreign interests.

In Rudny, Kazakh authorities violently suppressed a Russian community
meeting discussing the formation of a Cossack organization and aid for
struggling Orthodox priests. Following a half-hour meeting, dozens of
armed police and OMON forces stormed the building, brutally beating
unarmed attendees, including elderly individuals. Several people
sustained serious injuries, while others received moderate or minor
injuries. The organizers were subjected to biased interrogation, and
prisoners were held in uncomfortable positions. This incident is part of
a pattern of Kazakh authorities using force against Slavic populations,
including pogroms in other cities and the labeling of dissenters as
criminals. The situation is fueled by economic hardship and national
oppression, leading to rumors of forming Cossack partisan groups, and
the government relies heavily on a large security force presence.

This text is a detailed analysis of the political and security situation
in Central Asia during February and January 1998. It outlines a complex
web of tensions and shifting alliances within the region, primarily
focusing on Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. The core
themes are the destabilizing influence of Islamic fundamentalism,
particularly Wahhabism, fueled by ethnic tensions and the legacy of the
Soviet Union.

Key events and concerns highlighted include: a Tashkent and Dushanbe
summit addressing drug trafficking and regional security; a Central
Asian Economic Union summit in Ashkhabadd discussing cooperation;
ongoing territorial disputes (particularly concerning the Fergana
Valley); the spread of extremist Islamic groups, including the
involvement of Afghan-based militants; and the growing threat of a
potential conflict involving multiple nations.

The text emphasizes a growing distrust among Central Asian nations,
fueled by perceived Russian interference and the influence of Western
powers. It details a shift away from the Central Asian Economic Union
(CAEU) towards a more fragmented approach, with Uzbekistan taking a
leading role and seeking to consolidate its influence. The text
expresses concern about the potential for a wider conflict, potentially
involving Russia, NATO, and various Islamic militant groups. It
highlights the role of external actors, particularly the United States
and Western investment, and their impact on regional dynamics. The
analysis concludes with a warning about the potential for a dangerous
escalation, driven by unresolved tensions and the destabilizing
influence of extremist ideologies. The overall tone is one of deep
apprehension and a sense of impending crisis.

STONE FOR SWANIDGE

<p>
1998-02-23 - <b> Nikolay Anisin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a detailed exposé of corruption and mismanagement within
the Russian state television company, VGTRK, primarily during the 1990s.
It meticulously documents a pattern of illicit activity orchestrated by
the company’s leadership, particularly under the direction of Nikolai
Svanidze. The core of the report details how VGTRK systematically
acquired valuable state assets – two unfinished buildings and a large
plot of land – through shell companies like “RTR-Signal,” effectively
transferring state property into private hands without proper
compensation or oversight.

The report highlights a series of financial irregularities, including
the sale of state-owned equipment and vehicles at drastically reduced
prices, alongside the acceptance of substantial contributions from
private entities and individuals, often exceeding 75 million dollars. It
demonstrates a blatant disregard for financial regulations and a
systematic exploitation of the chaotic economic environment of the
post-Soviet era.

Crucially, the text emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between VGTRK
and the government, illustrating how the company was granted significant
autonomy and resources in exchange for its role as a propaganda tool.
The report argues that Svanidze’s leadership enabled a culture of
impunity, allowing for the systematic theft of state assets and the
manipulation of public opinion. The final conclusion is that the actions
surrounding “RTR-Signal” were fundamentally illegal and that the
authorities deliberately turned a blind eye to the corruption,
effectively sanctioning the illicit transfer of state property.

The text presents a complex and somewhat contradictory portrait of
modern Russian identity, shaped by a turbulent history. It describes a
new generation of Russian businessmen and athletes who are
simultaneously embracing capitalist endeavors and retaining strong ties
to traditional Russian values and institutions. This generation is
characterized by a dynamic and often contradictory nature – engaging in
both “wild capitalism” and preserving elements of Soviet-era sports
culture. They are depicted as facing pressure from both powerful Russian
bankers and foreign influences (specifically “Caucasian” traders),
leading them to gradually develop a more sophisticated understanding of
politics and a desire to protect their assets and heritage. The text
emphasizes a shift towards recognizing that “Russian business” extends
beyond mere material wealth to encompass a broader ideological and
cultural defense, ultimately seeking to safeguard their land,
traditions, and values – symbolized by churches, family gravesites, and
a resistance to “compromise” with foreign interests.

RUSSIAN RESISTANCE: PROPHETS AND LEADERS
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1998-03-16 - <b> Aleksandr Prokhanov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text presents a scathing critique of Russian opposition movements
in the 1990s, arguing they were fundamentally flawed and ultimately
doomed to failure. It accuses the opposition of abandoning genuine
resistance and instead adopting a cynical, manipulative strategy focused
on integration into the existing power structure.

The author contends that instead of fighting for the Russian people, the
opposition became absorbed by a “systemic” approach – a strategy of
creating a “shadow government” and appeasing the ruling elite. This
“shadow government” was characterized by a lack of genuine radicalism, a
reliance on political maneuvering rather than principled resistance, and
a failure to mobilize broad support.

The text paints a picture of a national crisis – a deliberate “genocide”
orchestrated by global financial forces – and frames the opposition’s
actions as a betrayal of this struggle. It calls for a new, truly
patriotic movement, led by a morally strong “prophet,” to defend Russian
culture, identity, and territory against this perceived threat. The
author emphasizes the need for a unified, multi-layered alliance
encompassing all segments of Russian society, rejecting the fragmented
and ultimately ineffective strategies of the previous opposition.

This text is a scathing critique of the political situation in Ukraine,
particularly focusing on the actions of President Leonid Kuchma and his
administration. It describes a system characterized by corruption,
manipulation of the media, and a deliberate suppression of dissent. The
author argues that the government is actively undermining democratic

The piece highlights specific instances of this manipulation, including
the unauthorized broadcast of critical commentary during a presidential
address and the actions taken against the newspaper “Pravda Ukraine.” It
portrays the government as skilled in using deceptive rhetoric and
exploiting public anxieties to maintain power.

Ultimately, the text expresses a sense of disillusionment and a growing
awareness among the Ukrainian people that the promises of reform are
empty and that the ruling elite are prioritizing their own interests
over the well-being of the nation. It suggests a slow but growing
recognition that the current system is fundamentally flawed and that

1998-03-23 - <b> Aleksandr Prokhanov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, highly critical, and somewhat rambling response
from a journalist, Lev Kaznachev, to an article by Kurginyan, a Russian
political commentator. Kaznachev dissects Kurginyan’s piece, arguing
that it’s driven by a misguided obsession with the “Russian factor” – a
mystical, historically-rooted concept of Russian identity. He believes
Kurginyan is attempting to manipulate public opinion and forge a
political coalition by exploiting anxieties about national identity and
historical grievances.

Kaznachev criticizes Kurginyan’s approach as overly simplistic and
dangerous, suggesting it’s fueled by a desire to demonize the “brown”
(or communist) elements of Russian society and to create a divisive
“nationalist” agenda. He sees Kurginyan’s attempts to revive a “red
meaning” – a mystical interpretation of Russian history – as ultimately
futile and potentially destructive.

The core of Kaznachev’s argument is that a genuine political solution
requires a broad coalition encompassing diverse viewpoints, including
those of figures like Kurginyan himself. He expresses a willingness to
engage in a difficult, potentially contentious dialogue, acknowledging
the inherent challenges and risks involved. He concludes by stating his
commitment to maintaining a space for open discussion and debate, even
if it means accommodating Kurginyan’s presence within their editorial
space.

</p>
<p>

This text expresses deep concern and criticism regarding the 1997 Diktat
(Agreement) between Russia and Ukraine, signed by Yeltsin and Kuchma.
The author argues that this agreement, particularly the recognition of
Ukraine’s territorial integrity, has been detrimental to Russia’s
interests and has fostered a hostile environment towards Russian
speakers and the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine.

The core argument is that the Diktat has enabled a deeply anti-Russian
regime in Kyiv to flourish, characterized by the suppression of Russian
culture and religion, the promotion of anti-Russian propaganda, and the
facilitation of NATO’s expansion into Ukraine. The author criticizes the
perceived betrayal of Russian interests by Yeltsin and subsequent
attempts to ratify the agreement, highlighting instances of persecution
of Russian speakers, the destruction of Russian Orthodox churches, and
the encouragement of anti-Russian organizations.

The text frames the situation as a deliberate effort to diminish
Russia’s influence in its historical sphere of influence, arguing that
the Diktat has effectively handed over Crimea and Sevastopol to Ukraine,
solidifying a hostile relationship and potentially paving the way for
further encroachment on Russian interests. The author concludes by
warning against blindly ratifying agreements with a regime that
fundamentally opposes Russia’s security and cultural identity.

Vladimir Smirnov, an ex-terrorist (as he describes himself), recounts
his experience after being arrested in 1993 for resisting Latvian police
while defending his wife from assault. He claims he was not resisting,
but responding to violence and protecting his wife’s honor. The incident
occurred in June 1995 when police, reportedly drunk and aggressive,
attempted to restrain his wife. Smirnov reacted by grabbing a rifle and
threatening them, leading to his arrest and a three-year sentence. He
believes the arrest was politically motivated, orchestrated by Latvian
authorities and potentially involving figures like the head of the
Latvian police security department, and possibly even the Latvian
Minister of Internal Affairs. He felt unjustly convicted and targeted

describes a pattern of abuse of power and corruption within the Latvian

This lengthy text outlines a proposed global transportation and
communication network centered around a “Trans-Sib” railway line
connecting Lisbon to New York. It argues for a new, terrestrial “world
axis” bypassing existing maritime routes. The core concept involves a
vast, interconnected railway system, dubbed “Trans-Sib,” supported by
“underhangs” (branches) extending across Asia and Africa.

The text emphasizes Russia’s central role in this network, viewing the
Trans-Sib as a key to economic and geopolitical influence. It frames the
project as a way to modernize transportation, stimulate trade, and
ultimately reshape global power dynamics.

The text highlights the historical significance of the Silk Road and
draws parallels between it and the proposed Trans-Sib, positioning it as
a modern iteration of this ancient trade route. It also touches on the
importance of establishing communication links across diverse regions,
including China, India, and the Middle East.

Finally, the text concludes with a somewhat nostalgic endorsement of
Russia’s role as a central player in this new global infrastructure,
referencing the historical importance of the Silk Road and the potential
for the Trans-Sib to become a vital artery for international trade and

This text is a passionate and somewhat paranoid critique of contemporary

Zionism. The author, Nikolai Kondratenko, argues that a shadowy network
of Zionists has been manipulating Russian affairs for decades, starting
with figures like Stalin and continuing through various political

Russia’s economy, culture, and national identity through tactics such as
manipulating prices (particularly energy), promoting divisive
ideologies, and exploiting the naivete of those seeking to modernize the
country.

Kondratenko believes this network operates by exploiting divisions
within Russian society, using figures like former communists and
promoting a worldview that prioritizes global influence over national
interests. He expresses deep concern about the manipulation of public
opinion through media and the deliberate obfuscation of historical
truth. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing this network’s
influence and urges vigilance among the Russian population, warning that
failure to do so will lead to further destruction of the nation. The
text concludes with a call for critical thinking and a rejection of

The text details a complex and highly orchestrated scheme involving
political manipulation and strategic interventions aimed at undermining
President Yeltsin and destabilizing Russia. Key elements include a
coordinated effort to support the candidate Boris Lebedev in
Krasnoyarsk, leveraging local control, financial support from Moscow
figures, and the exploitation of regional tensions, particularly in
Chechnya. The scheme involves manipulating Duma votes, potentially
through the forced resignation of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and
utilizing financial support to influence elections and consolidate
power. Foreign actors, including the US and key financial interests, are
actively involved, anticipating a significant capital outflow and aiming
to reshape Russia’s political landscape under Lebedev’s leadership, with
the ultimate goal of dismantling the Federation.

On April 28, 1998, a memorial event was held in Moscow to commemorate
the second anniversary of the “Grozdy Gneva” (Bouquet of Wrath)
operation, a brutal Israeli military action in Southern Lebanon in 1996.
The event, organized by the Russian-Lebanese Committee for Solidarity
with Southern Lebanon and Western Bekaa, featured speeches from Iranian,

of the Israeli occupation, support for the Lebanese Resistance,
particularly Hezbollah, and concerns about Western geopolitical

The text is a fragmented, almost surreal, account of a rural tragedy
centered around the forced removal of the Lyakhov family by authorities,
led by a man named Betsura. Betsura, a disillusioned and weary kolkhoz
organizer, is haunted by insomnia, nightmares, and a deep-seated
paranoia fueled by his work. He fixates on the disappearance of Mikhail
Lyakhov, a kulak, and becomes convinced that the authorities are
responsible.

The story unfolds through the perspective of Antomina, Lyakhov’s
daughter, who unexpectedly intercepts the removal of her father and
brother. The narrative is characterized by a sense of unease, punctuated
by unsettling imagery – the “empty, joyless night,” the “ghostly”
appearance of Betsura, and the unsettling feeling of being watched.

The removal itself is depicted as chaotic and unsettling, with figures
like Shnaydman (an OPU official) and Fokochin (a kolkhoz member)
involved. Antomina’s actions are driven by a mixture of fear and a
desperate desire to protect her family. The story ends ambiguously, with
rumors circulating about a woman resembling Antomina accompanying the
train carrying the Lyakhovs, and Betsura’s involvement remaining
unclear. The overall tone is one of disillusionment, paranoia, and the
tragic consequences of bureaucratic intervention in rural life.

This text is a transcript of a roundtable discussion in 1998 examining
the potential futures of humanity and Russia, particularly in light of
rapid technological advancements, primarily in cybernetics, genetics,
and information technology. Several experts – a political scientist, a
biophysicist, a philosopher, an America specialist, and the editor –
discuss the rise of a “technotronic” civilization driven by the United
States and its influence through figures like Stephen Hawking.

Key themes explored include: Hawking’s prediction of humanity’s
transformation into a new, technologically-driven species within 10-30
years, fueled by advancements like controlled nuclear fusion and
cybernetic brain-computer interfaces. The discussion highlights the
potential for a significant shift in global power dynamics, with the US
leveraging these technologies to establish a “new world order.”

Several participants express concern about the erosion of traditional
values and the potential for a loss of social cohesion, particularly
within Russia, due to the dominance of a “compromise” culture
prioritizing avoiding conflict over fundamental principles. There’s a
recognition that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent
embrace of a purely capitalist system, coupled with a lack of strategic
vision, has created a precarious situation.

Ultimately, the conversation emphasizes the need for a renewed
commitment to strategic thinking, a rejection of compromise, and a
defense of core values to navigate the challenges posed by this rapidly
evolving technological landscape. The experts acknowledge the slim
chances of Russia’s survival without a fundamental shift in its
approach.

KAGANAT: VZLET I PADENIE
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1998-05-04 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text presents two competing interpretations of the location of the
“Promised Land” for the Jewish people. The first, termed “Biblical,”
locates it in the traditional area of Palestine, associating it with
Moses and Zion. This view was held by figures like Theodor Herzl and
initially by Stalin, who established Israel in Palestine with support
from Allied powers (including Americans wary of a “shadow World
Government”). The author critiques this view, highlighting the perceived
“anti-Semitism” within it and the reliance on a specific historical
narrative.

The second interpretation, termed “Modernist,” originates from
Kabbalistic texts like the Zohar and locates the Promised Land in Gog
and Magog, post-Biblical, and linked to the rise of the Great Khazar
Khaganate. It argues that the Khazar Khaganate, a powerful and
influential state in Eastern Europe, predates and influenced the
development of both the Russian and Jewish identities. The author
details a debate among Jewish scholars regarding the origins of this
Khazar influence, referencing archaeological findings and the
“Khazar-Jewish correspondence.”

The text then explores the collapse of the Khazar Khaganate, attributing
it to internal divisions, particularly the introduction of a “messianic”
ideology by figures like Bulan (the “Custodian of Wealth”), which
undermined traditional Khazar governance. It suggests that the Khazar
Khaganate served as a “proto-Masonic” experiment, paving the way for
later revolutionary movements.

Finally, the author posits that the Khazar Khaganate represents a
significant, yet often overlooked, historical link between Jewish and
Russian identities, and suggests that Russia, like Palestine, holds a
special significance for the Jewish people, particularly in light of the
ongoing revival of Israel. The text concludes with a call for mutual
understanding and support between the Russian and Jewish peoples,
emphasizing the importance of recognizing shared historical roots and
spiritual values.

The text details a complex and highly critical assessment of Boris
Yeltsin’s leadership and the political situation in Russia during the
late 1990s. It reveals a power struggle within Yeltsin’s inner circle,
driven by short-term political calculations and fueled by a combination
of stimulants and personal rivalries. Key themes include: Yeltsin’s
manipulative use of “patriotic rhetoric” to gain support, particularly
through staged events and appeals to Soviet-era nostalgia; a desperate
attempt to secure new financial injections from Western countries; a
power struggle within the government, with figures like Rybakov and
Kirilenko gaining influence; a plan to destabilize the Duma through
unfavorable legislation; a growing sense of disillusionment and
criticism among influential figures like Aliyev, Shevardnadze, and
Berezhovsky; a recognition of Russia’s military and political weakness,
particularly in Chechnya; and a strategic plan to dismantle Gazprom and
exploit its assets for financial gain. The text paints a picture of a

<p>

This text is a transcript of a discussion between Gennady Zyuganov,
editors of “Zavtra” and “Sovetskaya Rossiya” newspapers, and the key
figures involved in the discussion. It details a meeting following the
April events in Duma, where the Communist Party of Russia (CPR) and
other patriotic factions attempted to influence the nomination of Sergei
Kirienko as Prime Minister.

Zyuganov explains that the CPR, along with other factions, initially
considered a vote for Kirienko, but ultimately withdrew their support
after recognizing the extent of Yeltsin’s influence and the damage done
to the party’s reputation. He attributes this withdrawal to a
miscalculation regarding the timing and the perceived lack of a clear
strategy to counter Yeltsin’s actions.

Zyuganov emphasizes that the situation is far more serious than
initially believed, describing it as a deliberate “genocide” of the
Russian people and culture orchestrated by Yeltsin and his allies. He
outlines a new strategy focused on a broader “national liberation
struggle,” involving a coalition of opposition forces, including
previously distant groups.

He announces the formation of a “shadow government” – the
Narodno-Patriotic Union of Russia – to train future leaders and
coordinate efforts across the country. Zyuganov asserts that the CPR
will develop a new ideology, “Russian Socialism,” combining traditional
Russian values with technological advancements.

The discussion highlights a shift in the CPR’s approach, moving from a
focus on parliamentary influence to a more radical strategy of national
resistance against what Zyuganov views as a deliberate attempt to
destroy Russia’s culture and identity. He frames the situation as a
critical juncture requiring a fundamental change in the party’s tactics
and ideology.

This text is a critical commentary on a carefully orchestrated attempt
to prolong Boris Yeltsin’s presidency through strategic statements made
by figures like Speaker of the Federation, Егор Строев, and Uzbek
President Islam Karimov. The core argument is that these pronouncements,
framed as “legal possibilities” for a third term, are deliberately
misleading and aimed at manipulating public opinion. The text highlights
discrepancies between the original, unedited English transcript of a
Yeltsin internet conference and the officially released Russian version,
where key phrases were altered to support the narrative of a potential
third term. Specifically, the original English transcript contained a
statement suggesting a concrete plan for future energy security, while
the edited Russian version used the ambiguous phrase “поживем — увидим”
(let’s see what happens). The text accuses these individuals of
participating in a staged “anti-constitutional spectacle,” emphasizing
that their actions are not genuine attempts to address concerns but
rather a calculated effort to maintain power. The “Parisian tours” of
Строев and Karimov are presented as further evidence of this
manipulation, reinforcing the idea that Yeltsin’s continued presidency
is being actively promoted, regardless of the actual circumstances.

This text is a highly skeptical and conspiratorial analysis of Boris
Yeltsin’s presidency, particularly focusing on events surrounding his
heart surgery in 1996. It argues that Yeltsin’s health was deliberately
misrepresented to maintain his power and that numerous inconsistencies
and manipulations were employed throughout his time in office.

The core argument is that Yeltsin’s health was deliberately obscured
through a series of staged events, including fabricated medical
interventions, altered photographs, and the suppression of dissenting
voices. The author highlights a pattern of “new” photographs appearing
after periods of illness, coupled with a lack of transparency regarding
his actual condition. It suggests that foreign advisors, particularly
Michael DeBakey, were involved in a scheme to prolong Yeltsin’s
presidency.

The text draws parallels to historical instances of deception,
specifically referencing the Khazar Khaganate and its use of false

<p>

This text is a critical and somewhat cynical observation of the capital
city of Kazakhstan, Almaty (now Nur-Sultan), and the broader state of
the country. It portrays a situation of disconnect between the
leadership and the realities of the population. The author highlights
the creation of a “phantom capital” – Brasília – as a cautionary tale,
mirroring the situation in Kazakhstan with President Nazarbayev’s
“park-like” capital built on depleted northern lands.

The piece emphasizes the superficiality of the regime’s efforts to
project an image of prosperity and modernity. Despite lavish spending on
infrastructure and a new, opulent capital, the country remains plagued
by economic stagnation, environmental degradation, and social problems.
The author details the disconnect between the elite’s extravagant
lifestyle and the struggles of ordinary citizens, illustrated by the
declining quality of local produce, the widespread unemployment, and the
rise in crime.

The text critiques the regime’s manipulation of symbols and slogans,
exemplified by the pervasive use of Nazarbayev’s quotes and the
promotion of a false narrative of national unity. It points to the
corruption and mismanagement within the government, as evidenced by the
decline of state-owned enterprises and the exploitation of resources.
The author uses the example of the university, once a center of
learning, now struggling with overcrowding and a lack of qualified
teachers, to underscore the broader systemic issues.

Ultimately, the text suggests that the leadership’s focus on projecting
an image of success is a deliberate distraction from the underlying
problems, and that the country’s future remains uncertain. It’s a
portrait of a nation where appearances are carefully constructed to mask
a deeper sense of disillusionment and decay.

This text explores the significance of the Soviet victory in World War
II, arguing that it was not solely a product of Soviet strength but a
miraculous intervention by God. The author contends that many
contemporary interpretations of the victory overlook this divine
element, particularly among those who downplay the role of faith and
religious belief.

The text highlights several key points: the Church’s recognition of the
victory as a divine blessing, exemplified by the “Dmitriev Day”
commemoration and the role of Metropolitan Iliya, who received
instructions from the Virgin Mary regarding how to aid Russia. It
emphasizes the importance of remembering the historical context,
specifically Alexander I’s words from 1812, which underscore the belief
that the victory was a manifestation of God’s will.

The author criticizes the tendency to attribute the victory solely to
Stalin’s leadership or to dismiss the role of faith. They suggest that a
proper understanding of the victory requires acknowledging God’s
intervention and the spiritual foundation upon which it was built. The
text ultimately argues that a failure to recognize this divine element

This text details the events surrounding a protest by miners in Moscow,
aimed at forcing the resignation of President Yeltsin. Initially, the
miners’ plan was to organize a sustained picket line outside the
government building, fueled by a simple slogan: “Yeltsin – resign!”
However, the initial effort quickly stalled, marked by internal
disagreements and a lack of coordination.

Key figures, including Viktor Anpilov and later, Georgi Kostin of the
CPRF, became involved, attempting to guide the miners’ actions. The
miners’ movement began to attract support from other groups, including
scientists and intellectuals, demonstrating a growing dissatisfaction
with Yeltsin’s leadership.

Crucially, the CPRF recognized the potential of the miners’ movement and
began to actively support it, culminating in a Pленум (Pленум) where
they defined their strategy, emphasizing the need for a more organized
and mass-based campaign. Despite the CPRF’s support, the movement
remained largely uncoordinated until after the Pленум, when the “Labor
Russia” headquarters, led by Anpilov, began distributing leaflets and
organizing support.

Ultimately, the miners’ actions, bolstered by the CPRF’s strategic
guidance and a growing sense of widespread discontent, played a
significant role in the eventual parliamentary vote to establish a
commission to investigate impeachment against Yeltsin, highlighting the
importance of organized labor movements in shaping political outcomes.

This text is a snapshot of a day in the life of a Russian special forces
unit, specifically a detachment commanded by “Gyrza” in a region near
Chechnya. It depicts a stark contrast between the unit’s rigorous
training and the often-difficult circumstances they face, highlighting
their resilience and reliance on unconventional support. The narrative
focuses on the daily routines – the grueling 40km marches, the constant
need to scavenge for supplies, and the emotional toll of prolonged

The story emphasizes the unit’s unique culture, characterized by a deep
sense of camaraderie and a willingness to operate outside of established

local businessmen, particularly the “Novy Torgovy Dom” (New Trading
House), is a crucial element of their survival. The text portrays a unit

1998-07-13 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text analyzes President Clinton’s 1998 visit to China, arguing it
was a complex and ultimately revealing event in the shifting global
power dynamics following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The author
presents a largely critical perspective, suggesting Clinton’s visit was
a strategic move by the US to acknowledge China’s rise as a major global
power, rather than a genuine attempt at fostering a strong partnership.

Initially, the visit was framed as a historic breakthrough, mirroring
Nixon’s visit and signaling the beginning of a strategic alliance.
However, the author contends this was a calculated maneuver by the US to
counter China’s growing economic and political influence. Chinese
analysts viewed the visit as a diplomatic defeat and a recognition of
China’s dominance, perceiving the US as a “paper tiger” attempting to
maintain its position.

The visit highlighted several key shifts: China’s burgeoning economy
surpassing levels of the USSR, the US’s increasing engagement with
China, and the growing influence of China within the global financial
system. The author emphasizes that the US was primarily motivated by
economic considerations, particularly the need to counter the rise of
the euro and maintain the dollar’s dominance.

The text suggests that Clinton’s visit was a pragmatic response to
China’s ascendance, acknowledging its growing power and setting the
stage for a future characterized by competition and potential conflict.
It frames the visit as a strategic move by the US to manage its
relationship with China, rather than a genuine attempt at collaboration.
The author draws parallels to Mao Zedong’s assessment of the US as a
“paper tiger,” suggesting that China’s rise would ultimately challenge
American hegemony.

conflicting reports, investigations, and manipulations surrounding the
circumstances of Tsar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and their

The piece repeatedly highlights the lack of definitive answers and the

The text expresses frustration with the ongoing attempts to resolve the
mystery, arguing that the investigation has been plagued by
misinformation, political agendas, and a deliberate obfuscation of the
facts. It criticizes the state’s handling of the remains, highlighting
the secrecy surrounding the exhumation and disposal of the remains. The
author emphasizes the lack of a truly objective and transparent
investigation, suggesting that the issue remains a politically charged
and unresolved matter. The piece concludes with a lament for the lack of
proper burial of the Tsar’s remains and a call for a more honest and
respectful approach to this historical tragedy.

The competition for a new “Order of Stalin” concluded with a selected
design being chosen. The design incorporates elements of Russian
national heraldry, emphasizing Stalin’s scale, determination, austerity,
and service to the state. It features a Богородичная star with stars
representing economic, political, ideological, and cultural struggle,
alongside a relief portrait of Stalin in a military uniform with medals,
and the inscription “СТАЛИН. ДЕРЖАВА. ВЕРА. ПОБЕДА.” The first orders
will be produced in the coming months.

A small autumn rain shower
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1998-07-27 - <b> Roman Romov </b>
</p>
<p>

The story is a surreal and darkly comedic narrative centered around a
small, rundown shop called “Магазин” in an unspecified location. The
main characters – Волков, Хубилай, Сережа, and Сонька – engage in a
series of bizarre and escalating confrontations, fueled by a strange,
almost ritualistic energy. Their interactions are marked by absurd
dialogue, violent outbursts, and a pervasive sense of disorientation.

The narrative unfolds through a fragmented, almost dreamlike sequence of
events, including a bizarre encounter with a yellow-clad old man, a
radio broadcast playing a melancholic Russian folk song by Fyodor
Chaliapin, and a surreal chase involving a “Mercedes,” a three-headed
dragon, and a collapsing world.

The story explores themes of isolation, frustration, and the search for
meaning, presented through a highly stylized and deliberately illogical
lens. The characters’ actions, though violent and chaotic, seem to stem
from a deep-seated dissatisfaction and a desperate need for connection,
even if that connection is ultimately destructive. The ending, with the
old man’s final glance and the radio’s final broadcast, reinforces the
story’s unsettling and ambiguous nature.

This document details the tragic suicide of Captain Vladimir Bituykov of
the Russian Armed Forces in 1998, stemming from severe financial
hardship and systemic neglect within the military. Bituykov, suffering
from a serious illness and burdened by a large family, faced significant
delays in receiving his pay and inadequate financial support. The
document outlines a breakdown in funding, with the vast majority of the
military budget allocated to personnel payments and personnel
reductions, rather than vital areas like equipment maintenance,
training, or research. The financial prioritization of troop reductions,
coupled with the commander’s perceived callousness, pushed Bituykov to
despair and ultimately, suicide. The text highlights a critical
situation where the military was being starved of resources, leading to
the demise of a dedicated soldier and family.

</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the Russian government’s stance
regarding the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) and its
potential ratification. The author argues that Russia’s actions are
driven not by a genuine desire for strategic parity with the United
States, but rather by a desperate need to maintain a façade of power and
dependence on American financial and technological support.

The core argument is that Russia’s leadership is being manipulated by
the United States, who see Russia as a pliable pawn in their
geopolitical strategy. Ratifying START II would further diminish
Russia’s sovereignty, ceding control over its nuclear forces and
facilitating the expansion of NATO.

The author contends that Russia’s military weakness and economic
struggles necessitate a shift in focus from strategic parity to
bolstering its own defense capabilities, regardless of American demands.
The author dismisses arguments for ratification as simplistic and driven
by a desire to appease the Clinton administration and facilitate the
“confederation” of Russia.

Ultimately, the text portrays Russia’s current predicament as a
consequence of past concessions and a reliance on external support,
urging a rejection of START II and a prioritization of Russia’s own
security interests.

SADDAM’S EXPERIENCE - FOR FRIENDS OF RUSSIA
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1998-08-24 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This letter, written by Akif Bagemsky, a leader of the “Tomorrow”
(Zavtra) newspaper, vehemently refutes the sentiment expressed in “The
Heart’s Pain” by Akeem Bagemsky, which praises Saddam Hussein. Bagemsky
criticizes the article for romanticizing Hussein and comparing him to
figures like Pinochet and Somoza.

Bagemsky argues that Hussein’s popularity stems from his effective
leadership and policies, particularly his nationalization of foreign oil
companies and implementation of social reforms, which contrasted sharply
with Western capitalist interests. He highlights the Iraqi people’s
history of resisting foreign occupation and their unwavering support for
Hussein, even during the devastating 1991 Gulf War.

Bagemsky emphasizes that Hussein’s leadership is rooted in a genuine
desire to serve his people, illustrated by Hussein’s own words about
prioritizing the needs of his nation. He contrasts this with the
perceived failings of the Yeltsin regime and calls for future Russian
leaders to learn from Hussein’s example, particularly his commitment to
democratic reforms and social justice. Ultimately, Bagemsky sees Hussein
as a strong, independent leader who resisted the imposition of a new
world order, a position he believes is a far more accurate reflection of
reality than Bagemsky’s sentimental portrayal.

This text presents a highly critical and conspiratorial analysis of the
situation in Afghanistan, particularly concerning the Taliban and its
connections to various international actors. It argues that the Taliban
are a product of a deliberate, multi-national project orchestrated by
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Israel. The author
contends that the conflict in Afghanistan is not a spontaneous uprising
but a carefully engineered scheme to destabilize Russia and potentially
expand influence into Central Asia.

Key arguments include: the Taliban are trained and funded by Pakistan
and Saudi Arabia, they are not a genuinely independent force but rather
a tool used by these nations, and the conflict is driven by a desire to
weaken Russia. The text suggests a complex web of manipulation, with the
Taliban serving as a proxy force, and accuses various countries of
deliberately “feeding” the conflict to achieve their own strategic
goals. It highlights the involvement of figures like Nasurullo Bobarov,
a former Pakistani Interior Minister, and suggests a future exchange of
embassies between the Taliban and Chechnya.

The author uses a highly skeptical tone, questioning the motivations of
all involved and portraying the situation as a deliberate, ongoing
“feeding” of the conflict to prevent a genuine resolution. It draws
parallels to the Nazi appeasement strategy, warning against attempting
to appease the Taliban.

1998-08-31 - <b> Vladimir Bushin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy, satirical reflection on the legacy of Russia’s
first Romanov Tsar, Michael Fedorovich, and a pointed critique of
contemporary Russia under Yeltsin and, implicitly, Putin. It’s a
historical comparison framed as a series of observations, often
delivered with a cynical and ironic tone. The core argument is that
while Michael Fedorovich oversaw significant territorial expansion and
established key institutions like the Treasury Office, his reign
ultimately laid the groundwork for future instability and corruption.

The author uses a series of anecdotes and comparisons to highlight the
contrast between Michael’s relatively stable and prosperous rule and the
chaotic and often destructive policies of later Russian leaders. Key
themes include: the cyclical nature of Russian history, the recurring
problems of corruption and mismanagement, and the importance of
respecting national traditions and values. The text employs a sarcastic
and critical voice, questioning the motivations and actions of
contemporary political figures by drawing parallels to historical
figures like Michael Fedorovich and, more pointedly, comparing Yeltsin
to a “scorpion” – a creature that needs to be watched closely.

The piece is filled with pointed observations about the present,
particularly regarding the economic situation, the actions of political
leaders, and the overall direction of Russia. It ends with a poignant
question about whether Yeltsin truly loves Russia, mirroring a
historical inquiry about Michael Fedorovich’s devotion to his country.

This text details a complex web of criminal activity centered around the
VAZ (Voskhod Automobile Plant) in Togliatti, Russia, during the late
1990s. The core issue revolves around corruption, extortion, and violent
conflict between numerous criminal groups vying for control of the
plant’s lucrative operations, primarily related to vehicle parts trading
and illicit dealings.

The story unfolds through a series of interconnected events, starting
with the collapse of the plant due to railway strikes and the
involvement of corrupt officials. Several key groups are identified,
including “Ялкын” (Yalkyn), a trading company founded by individuals
largely from Tatarstan, and various other criminal organizations like
those led by figures such as Dremin, the “Big Dim,” and the notorious
“Yalkyn” leadership.

The narrative highlights a pattern of bribery, intimidation, and
violence, with numerous individuals – including plant managers, drivers,
and security personnel – caught in the crossfire. Several murders are
described, notably those of Болотов (Bolotov), Тпак (Tpak), Шамиль
Митяев (Shamil Mityaev), and the involvement of figures like Aмиран
(Amiran) and the “Big Dim” in a planned meeting to discuss the future of
the VAZ under financial strain.

A significant element of the story is the discovery of a massive arsenal
– including firearms, grenades, and ammunition – hidden within the
“Ялкын” trading company’s offices, revealing the scale of the criminal
enterprise. The text ultimately portrays a chaotic and dangerous
environment where corruption and violence were rampant, with numerous
individuals caught in a brutal struggle for control and profit.

This text is a scathing critique of corruption and mismanagement within
the administration of the Siberian region of Kuzbass (Kemerovo) in
Russia during the mid-1990s. It details a series of interconnected
scandals involving misappropriated funds, fraudulent contracts, and
blatant abuse of power.

The core issues center around the “Fata” project – a misguided attempt
to revitalize the region’s aluminum industry – which was plagued by
inflated contracts, diverted funds, and a lack of accountability.
Specifically, 205 million dollars intended for equipment was largely
squandered, and a massive amount of aluminum was sold at significantly
below market value.

Key figures implicated include Sergei Loparev, who was accused of
illegally selling state-owned aluminum and exploiting his position, and
Sergei Kisluk, the then-governor, who oversaw the disastrous project and
consistently concealed information. The text highlights the role of
corrupt banking practices, with exorbitant interest rates and short-term
loans used to enrich officials.

Despite numerous investigations and complaints filed with the Prosecutor
General’s Office, no serious action was taken, and the perpetrators
largely escaped justice. The text emphasizes the systemic nature of the
corruption, the lack of oversight, and the failure of the authorities to
hold anyone accountable. It paints a picture of a region where
corruption thrived unchecked, leaving a trail of financial ruin and
wasted resources.

This text is a rambling, paranoid monologue delivered by a man named
Grigory Klimov, a Russian writer, in 1998. He expresses a deeply cynical
and conspiratorial worldview, blaming a global network of “degenerates”
– individuals with a desire for power and a tendency towards sadism –
for manipulating world events and causing widespread destruction. Klimov
believes this network, known as “degenerates,” operates through secret

actively identifying and grooming individuals for positions of power. He
argues that these “degenerates” are driven by repressed homosexuality
and a desire for control, and that their actions result in immense
suffering for ordinary people. He draws heavily on a pseudo-scientific
theory, referencing a “Harvard Project” and the concept of “degenerate”
behavior, using it to explain political and social turmoil. Throughout
his monologue, he repeatedly emphasizes the destructive nature of this
network, comparing it to biological weapons and suggesting that it’s a

This text is a cynical and critical commentary on the newly appointed
Governor of Krasnoyarsk, Alexander Lebed, and his administration. It
expresses deep skepticism about his leadership, attributing his initial
successes to manipulation and a reliance on “outsiders” and “temporary”
appointees. The author argues that Lebed is a “puppet” of Moscow, driven
by a desire for personal recognition rather than genuine concern for the

The piece highlights a perceived pattern of empty promises – pledges to
create jobs, reduce debt, and attract investment – alongside a troubling
influx of “Muscovites” into key positions. It criticizes Lebed’s
tendency to surround himself with these individuals, viewing it as a
deliberate attempt to create an illusion of progress and control. The
author expresses concern about the influence of figures like Berezhovsky

The text is filled with sarcasm and pointed observations about the

</p>
<p>

This text is a transcript of a lengthy, critical discussion between two
figures, Alexander Prokhanov and Valentin Chikin, reflecting on the
tumultuous period following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
leadership of Boris Yeltsin. The core argument revolves around the
perceived failings of the current Russian government and the need for a
new, strong national project.

Prokhanov and Chikin express deep skepticism about the current
government, viewing it as weak, lacking a clear vision, and susceptible
to manipulation by Western influences and internal factions. They
believe the government is failing to address the underlying issues of
national identity and security, and that it’s being driven by
short-sighted, opportunistic individuals.

A key theme is the need for a “great Russian project” – a unifying
national vision – to guide the country’s future. They suggest that this
project should be spearheaded by a strong, patriotic leader, possibly a
governor like Konoteyev, rather than the current, perceived weak
leadership.

The conversation is filled with historical references, critiques of past
leaders (Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin, Kirilenko), and anxieties about Western
influence. They express a belief in a “silent” but powerful force – a
“noosphere” – that protects Russia from external threats. They also
highlight the importance of recognizing and addressing the deep-seated
resentment and frustration within the Russian population.

Ultimately, the text presents a pessimistic assessment of the current
state of Russia and a call for a fundamental shift in leadership and
national direction, emphasizing the need for a strong, patriotic figure
to restore stability and guide the country towards a renewed sense of
national identity.

The text details a significant, impromptu gathering at the Holy Daniel
Monastery in Moscow, convened by Patriarch Alexey II. The core purpose
was to address the perceived crisis facing Russia and to explore
pathways for national unity and recovery. Key figures present included
the Speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznev, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzkhov,
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, and numerous other prominent figures across various
sectors.

The discussions centered around the failures of recent economic reforms,
particularly the radical shift towards a market economy, which led to
widespread corruption and a loss of faith in the government. Luzkhov
forcefully criticized the lack of clear goals and the prioritization of
personal gain over national interests. He emphasized the urgent need to
restore traditional Russian values and address the moral decay he
perceived within society.

Patriarch Alexey II called for a broad consensus and a renewed focus on
national unity, urging participants to overcome the divisions and
radicalism that threatened the country’s stability. The gathering was
viewed as a critical moment to reassess the direction of Russia and to
forge a path towards a more stable and prosperous future, with a strong
emphasis on restoring traditional values and addressing the deep-seated
social and economic problems. The event was seen as a symbolic attempt
to steer the country away from the perceived chaos and towards a more
unified and purposeful course.

1998-10-19 - <b> Eduard Volodin </b>
</p>
<p>
The author recounts a trip to Belgrade during the tense period
surrounding the potential NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. He observes a
surprisingly calm and resilient populace, largely unfazed by the looming
threat and focused on daily life. He expresses skepticism about Western
intentions, viewing the situation as a calculated provocation aimed at
destabilizing Serbia and ultimately dismantling Orthodox Christian
civilization. The author believes Western powers are driven by a
cynical, anti-Christian agenda and that Russian diplomacy has been
ineffective. He emphasizes the importance of faith and the role of the
icon of the Theotokos Troеруchitsa as a protector of the Serbian people,
framing the conflict as a spiritual battle against Satanism.

<p>
1998-10-19 - <b> Igorʹ Shafarevich </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, written in 1998 by Igor Shafarevich, analyzes the Kosovo
crisis as a strategic move by NATO and the United States to further
their global dominance and dismantle Yugoslavia. Shafarevich argues that
the “Kosovo crisis” is a deliberate tactic, mirroring historical
attempts at domination, such as Sargon of Akkad’s and Hitler’s actions.
He criticizes the inaction of Russia and the perceived weakness of the
international community, particularly the UN Security Council, which
failed to address the escalating situation.

Shafarevich views the crisis as part of a larger “new world order” being
imposed through military pressure and the manipulation of international
institutions. He expresses concern that Russia is failing to adequately
respond, advocating for a firm and uncompromising stance, including
rejecting NATO partnerships and establishing a permanent parliamentary
representation in Yugoslavia to safeguard Russia’s interests. The author
concludes that the crisis represents a fundamental shift in global power
dynamics, demanding a radical re-evaluation of Russia’s foreign policy
and a commitment to resisting the imposition of a “new world order.”

1998-10-26 - <b> Aleksey Yakovlev-Kozyrev </b>
</p>
<p>
The text is a fragmented, almost dreamlike narrative recounting a series
of experiences and observations related to a journey to Mount Athos,
specifically the Holy Mountain. It’s a deeply spiritual and reflective
piece, focusing on moments of awe, fear, and connection with nature and
the divine. The narrator describes a series of encounters – from
observing celestial phenomena like moons and stars, to experiencing
intense, almost paralyzing fear during a confrontation with a demonic
apparition, to contemplating the history and significance of ancient
sites like ruined temples and religious structures. Throughout, there’s
a recurring theme of confronting the darker aspects of existence,
symbolized by the presence of demons and the potential for destructive
forces. The narrative emphasizes the importance of inner transformation
and spiritual resilience, highlighting the value of prayer and faith in
overcoming fear and doubt. The final section evokes a sense of
transcendence, suggesting a journey not just geographically, but also
spiritually, towards a deeper understanding of existence and the divine.

1998-11-02 - <b> Andrey Fefelov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, a transcript of an interview with researcher Alexander Titov,
explores the idea of a hidden, influential group operating within
Russian television, particularly around the NTV channel. Titov’s
investigation suggests a complex, hierarchical system exists beneath the
surface of the media landscape, driven by a secretive organization he
refers to as a “television sect” or “lodge,” possibly linked to the
“Boiling Clay” lodge.

The interview reveals a belief that this group deliberately undermines
Russia’s progress, though they claim to have no specific interest in its
demise. They utilize television – through symbols, imagery, and
messaging – to subtly influence the population. Titov describes a hidden
chamber beneath the Ostan Kintelev complex, containing a symbolic altar
and a connection to ancient, negative forces. The text suggests a
connection between this group and figures like Kiselyov, Mitkov, and
Lobkov, potentially marked by a specific magical tattoo. The overall
narrative paints a picture of a powerful, manipulative force operating
within the Russian media, utilizing ancient symbolism and a deliberate
distortion of reality.

The author expresses frustration with the disproportionate and dishonest
reaction to General Makashov’s controversial statement about being taken
to a dozen graves if tortured. He criticizes the media’s hysterical
portrayal of Makashov and other communists as fascists, highlighting the
fabricated accusations and the manipulation of historical context,
including the frequent use of Nazi-era films. The author laments the
lack of investigation into the death of Stanislav Volkov and the
immediate blaming of Makashov. He finds the entire situation absurd,
noting the media’s relentless focus on Makashov’s words rather than
genuine issues, and expresses a surprising admiration for Makashov’s
resilience and a potential vote for him in a presidential election.

The text argues that Russia’s past successes were rooted in placing
faith—specifically Orthodox Christianity—at the center of national life.
It criticizes contemporary Russia for neglecting faith, citing the
example of the Jewish teachers who questioned the Christian faith and
the need to prioritize spiritual renewal. The text suggests that
Russia’s future depends on a return to Orthodox values and that victory
over enemies and achieving national triumph are contingent upon divine
blessing and a rejection of secular influences like “satansky”
television programs.

The United States is continuing its efforts to gain unrestricted access
to Caspian oil. Concerns exist about the potential disruption to Western
economies due to the dominance of American capital in the Persian Gulf
and the increasing interest in former Soviet territories, particularly
Kazakhstan, which holds significant oil reserves. The US is actively
attempting to influence the upcoming presidential elections in
Kazakhstan, backing a candidate (Abildin) to ensure favorable access to
oil resources, despite opposition to another candidate (Kazhegeldin) and
potential disruptions to existing relationships with the current
president. The US is willing to risk established ties to secure a
pro-Russian administration under Abildin.

The Russian State Duma is considering a law to legalize pornography,
dubbed the “Govorukhin Code” after its initial proponent. The law,
sparked by a Duma committee, has caused a scandal with negative
reactions from religious and patriotic groups who fear it will normalize
immoral behavior. Proponents argue that distinctions between “erotica”
and “pornography” are unclear, suggesting that even displaying
educational materials about sexuality could be legally protected. Key
figures involved include sex shop owner and educator A. Agakov, and Duma
Speaker Gennady Seleznev, along with support from some Communist
deputies. The law is framed as protecting “the moral health of
citizens,” and critics believe it benefits those involved in the adult
entertainment industry.

The text details a complex and highly speculative scenario involving
political maneuvering, power struggles, and predictions surrounding the
Russian political landscape in the late 1990s. It outlines plans by
“democratic” figures to oust President Yeltsin through various means,
including manipulating public opinion, exploiting anti-Semitic
sentiments, and potentially staging a coup. Predictions regarding
election outcomes for various parties, particularly Zyunov’s ZUN and
Yavlinsky’s YABLONKA, are presented, alongside assessments of Yeltsin’s
declining health and the potential for a financial crisis triggered by
the introduction of the Euro. The text also discusses preparations for
potential political exile for key figures like Berezhovsky and others,
and highlights concerns about security threats and the manipulation of
information by various factions.

1998-11-30 - <b> Andrey Orlov </b>
</p>
<p>
The text argues that Western financial aid to Russia in the 1990s,
ostensibly intended to support a “young democratic Russia,” was largely
diverted to fuel organized crime and corruption. Massive cash infusions,
including a $500 million transfer ahead of the 1996 elections and
subsequent flows through exchange points, were funneled into criminal
organizations. These funds were not used for economic development but
instead facilitated the corruption of government officials, the
acquisition of weapons and drugs, and the rise of a criminal elite.
Western financial assistance exacerbated Russia’s problems, leading to a
surge in crime and long-term debt, and the lack of accountability
surrounding these funds allowed criminal networks to flourish. The text
uses the murder of Anastasia Starovoitova as an example of the
consequences of this corruption.

This text describes Pavel Lobkov, a prominent and controversial figure
on the Russian television channel NTV. Lobkov is portrayed as a
deliberately manufactured image – a “true intellectual” and moral critic
who exposes perceived flaws in Russian society, particularly liberal
values. His broadcasts are characterized by superficiality, arrogance,
and a calculated provocation. Lobkov’s role is that of a deliberate
instigator, often generating scandals for financial gain. Despite his
unpopularity among colleagues and his lack of independent projects due
to internal resistance, he maintains his position at NTV, likened to a

OPERATION “YAVLINSKY”
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1998-12-14 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a cynical and critical analysis of how the television
channel NTV was constructing a public image of Grigory Yavlinsky. It
argues that NTV was deliberately crafting a carefully constructed,
almost artificial, image of Yavlinsky – a “clean” and “democratic”
figure – through a series of strategically released “fragments” or
pieces of information. These fragments presented Yavlinsky as a
visionary, a fighter against corruption, a champion of fair elections,
and ultimately, a figure designed to manipulate public opinion. The
author expresses skepticism about this process, suggesting it’s a
calculated and ultimately deceptive effort. They highlight the
deliberate omission of uncomfortable facts about Yavlinsky’s past,
particularly his involvement in the August 1991 raid on the apartment of
a political opponent, and the use of inflammatory rhetoric (“Раздавить
гадину!” – “Crush the villain!”). The text concludes by proposing to
actively counter this manufactured image, using specific details – like
the image of Yavlinsky with a pistol – to expose the artificiality and
potentially dangerous nature of the constructed persona.

This text recounts the author’s experiences and observations while a
prisoner of war in a German camp during World War II, specifically
focusing on his interactions with Jakov Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili (son of
Stalin). The author, a Baltic German officer, details how the story of
Jakov’s voluntary surrender to the Germans and subsequent collaboration
was a fabricated German propaganda campaign. He describes meeting Jakov
in a segregated section of the camp, where Jakov was undergoing a
psychological “treatment” orchestrated by his German handler,
Zonderführer Chudovsky. Jakov, despite his low rank and impoverished
state, consistently rejected German offers of wealth and support,
revealing a deep sadness and a poignant memory of his stepmother. He
confessed a secret, unrequited love for her, and shared details about
his childhood, including a clandestine baptism arranged by his
grandmother. Ultimately, Jakov attempted a desperate escape, resulting
in his death by electrocution. The author then performed a memorial
service for Jakov’s soul.

This text expresses deep skepticism and criticism regarding the
political situation and media portrayal of Kazakhstan, particularly
concerning the treatment of the Russian population. The author argues
that Валерий Лунев’s article in “Zavtra” newspaper is deliberately
misleading, filled with disinformation, and designed to bolster

strategically manipulating media outlets, including Russian television,
to secure support for upcoming elections in Kazakhstan, where a
significant portion of the electorate is comprised of elderly Russian
voters facing hardship. The author highlights the suppression of Russian
voices and organizations, citing arrests and violence against Russian
activists and leaders. He criticizes the selective reporting of events,
particularly the failure to acknowledge the dire conditions faced by
Russian communities and the ongoing human rights abuses perpetrated by
the Nazarbayev regime. The text paints a bleak picture of a politically

This text is a scathing critique of the state of scientific research and
technological development in Russia, particularly within the
military-industrial complex. It argues that a deliberate and systematic
effort is underway to dismantle Russia’s scientific capabilities through
a combination of funding cuts, the exploitation of scientists through
lucrative but ultimately destructive projects, and the infiltration of
the system by corrupt individuals and foreign entities.

The author details a cycle of manipulation where scientists are bought
with small sums of money, lured into pursuing unproductive research
paths, and ultimately, their valuable knowledge is stolen and exploited
for profit. The core issue is the lack of genuine state support for
scientific endeavors, coupled with the prioritization of short-term
gains and the influence of corrupt actors who prioritize personal
enrichment over national scientific advancement.

The text highlights specific examples of this process, including the
manipulation surrounding hydrogen research, the theft of intellectual
property, and the exploitation of scientists by foreign companies and
individuals. It paints a picture of a system where scientific progress
is actively sabotaged, and the future of Russian technological
development is bleak due to a combination of systemic corruption and a
deliberate lack of investment in its own scientific talent. The author
concludes with a stark warning: if the situation isn’t addressed, the
destruction of Russian science is inevitable.

Oh, sport, you are a myth…

<p>
1998-12-27 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a cynical and somewhat rambling critique of Russian sports,
particularly its relationship with politics and economics. It argues
that the Soviet system’s obsession with sporting success, fueled by a
desire to prove itself to the West, ultimately led to a distorted and
unsustainable model. The author contends that the focus shifted from
genuine sporting development to a desperate pursuit of medals and
international prestige, driven by a need to demonstrate Soviet power.

The piece highlights the 1972 “Super Series” between the Soviet Union
and Canada as a prime example of this problem. The author suggests that
the Soviet team’s performance was not driven by sporting excellence but
by a political agenda and a desire to impress the West. The disbanding
of the Soviet sports teams in 1952 and 1955 is presented as a necessary
corrective to this unhealthy obsession.

Ultimately, the text argues that the Soviet system’s approach to sports
was fundamentally flawed, prioritizing political goals over genuine
sporting development and leading to a cycle of disillusionment and
ultimately, failure. The author advocates for a return to a more
authentic and less politically motivated approach to sports, suggesting
that disbanding the national teams and focusing on developing young
talent would be a more effective strategy.
