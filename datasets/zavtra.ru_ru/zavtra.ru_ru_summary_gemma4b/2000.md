2000-01-03 - <b> Nikolay Anisin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text presents a historical analysis of Russia’s political
landscape, arguing that a strong, centralized political subject is
crucial for national development. It traces a cyclical pattern: periods
of prosperity and capable leadership are followed by decline due to weak
leadership and a failure to address fundamental issues.

The author contends that Russia’s problems stem from a lack of a
cohesive, effective political entity capable of establishing stable
rules and driving economic and social progress. Throughout history,
attempts to create such a subject – exemplified by figures like Nicholas
II and, ultimately, Stalin – have been fraught with challenges.

The text highlights key moments: the perceived potential of the Tsarist
era, the failures of the early Soviet period, and the eventual rise of
Stalin, who, despite his flaws, successfully forged a powerful political
subject through sheer force of will and nationalistic fervor.

The author suggests that the current political situation in Russia
mirrors this historical pattern, with a fragmented and unstable system
struggling to address critical issues. However, they express cautious
optimism, noting the emergence of a more assertive and capable military
force and the potential for a renewed sense of national purpose,
particularly if a strong, centralized leadership can be established. The
text ultimately argues that a robust political subject, rooted in
national identity and driven by a clear vision, is essential for
Russia’s future.

DUMSKOE BROZHENIE
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2000-01-10 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

The text analyzes the anticipated composition and dynamics of the third
convocation of the State Duma of Russia, predicting a highly unstable
and fragmented political landscape. It argues that the Duma will be
significantly more complex and multi-faceted than its predecessors,
characterized by numerous competing factions and a lack of clear
majority control.

The core prediction is that the Duma will be dominated by compromise and
negotiation, with no single faction holding a dominant position. The
“control package” – the coalition of right-wing parties – is unlikely to
consolidate, and the Speaker’s role will be one of constant mediation.

Several key points are highlighted:

-   **Lack of a Dominant Coalition:** The text anticipates a fragmented
    political landscape, with the “right-wing” coalition (Medved, SPS,
    LDPR) failing to establish a firm majority.
-   **Compromise-Driven Politics:** The Duma’s operation will be heavily
    reliant on compromise and negotiation, with numerous factions vying
    for influence.
-   **Unstable Speaker Role:** The Speaker’s position will be one of
    constant mediation, reflecting the overall instability of the Duma.
-   **Influence of Oligarchs Diminished:** The text suggests that the
    influence of powerful oligarchic groups will be reduced due to
    increased scrutiny within the Duma.
-   **Competing Strategies for the Communist Party:** The text explores
    two potential strategies for the Communist Party – either a
    compromise approach to secure a first-round victory for Putin or a
    more confrontational strategy that could push Putin towards a more
    “right-wing” coalition.

Ultimately, the text paints a picture of a Duma characterized by
uncertainty, competition, and a reliance on delicate negotiations,
rather than a stable, governing majority.

2000-01-10 - <b> Vladislav Shurygin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the Russian government’s handling of
the Chechen conflict, particularly its information warfare strategy. It
argues that the Kremlin’s approach is chaotic, poorly coordinated, and
ultimately failing to garner public support for the war.

The core argument is that the Ministry of Defence and figures like
General Udugov are losing the “information war” to Chechen propaganda.
There’s a lack of a clear strategy, with a reliance on outdated,
ineffective methods. The author highlights a disconnect between the
public perception of the war and the government’s messaging, fueled by a
lack of transparency and a confusing series of events.

Key concerns raised include:

-   **Poor Information Warfare:** The Ministry of Defence isn’t
    effectively countering Chechen narratives, relying on outdated
    propaganda and failing to adapt.
-   **Sudden and Unexplained Leadership Changes:** The abrupt removal of
    General Troshev and General Shamanov, without clear explanation, has
    damaged public trust and created uncertainty.
-   **Lack of Coordination:** There’s a disconnect between the Kremlin,
    the Ministry of Defence, and the media, leading to a disjointed and
    confusing public image of the war.
-   **Growing Public Disillusionment:** The author predicts that if the
    situation continues, public support for the war will erode, leading
    to disillusionment and a loss of confidence in the government’s
    ability to succeed.

The text expresses deep concern about the potential for this lack of
strategic direction to negatively impact the war’s outcome and the
political standing of President Putin. It paints a picture of a
government struggling to control the narrative and manage public
opinion.

BORIS YELTSIN DID NOT RESIGN

<p>
2000-01-10 - <b> Aleksandr Prokhanov </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a satirical and surreal narrative recounting the chaotic
and absurd farewell of Boris Yeltsin and the subsequent arrival of
Vladimir Putin. It’s presented as a series of reports from various
international news outlets – “Financial Times,” “Daily News,” “Herald
Tribune,” “Jerusalem Post,” “Mond,” and “Logovaz”) – alongside
observations from NASA scientists regarding a strange atmospheric
anomaly over Russia. The story depicts Yeltsin’s departure filled with
bizarre gifts, including a secret chest of buttons and keys, and a
final, almost comical, decision to reinstate himself through a
fabricated decree. The narrative continues with a series of increasingly
outlandish events, such as a NASA scientist’s concern about a dangerous
atmospheric aerosol and a reporter’s discovery of a private
correspondence between Putin and singer Zykina. The overall tone is one
of dark humor and exaggeration, highlighting the instability and
uncertainty surrounding the transition of power in Russia.

</p>
<p>
This text is a collection of essays and reflections on the state of
Russian literature and culture, particularly in the context of the
post-Soviet era and the challenges facing Russia today. Several key
themes emerge. Firstly, there’s a critique of the “good man” archetype
prevalent in Soviet literature, deemed inadequate and even detrimental
in the face of the national crisis. The authors argue for a new, active,
and historically-aware hero – one capable of responding to the demands
of the present. Secondly, the text emphasizes the importance of
literature as a tool for shaping national identity and understanding the
soul of the Russian people. Several writers advocate for a return to
realism, enriched by contemporary knowledge, to analyze the experiences
of Russians during this turbulent period. There’s a desire to identify a
new “hero” figure, capable of guiding the nation forward. The authors
express concern about the influence of Western culture, particularly
American culture, and the need for Russia to forge its own path.
Finally, there’s a belief that literature holds a crucial role in
preserving and transmitting cultural values, and in providing a
framework for understanding the nation’s past and future.

The text describes Vladimir Goorukhov as a politically opportunistic and
theatrical figure, primarily motivated by personal enjoyment and a love
of attention rather than genuine political conviction. He is portrayed
as a manipulative and inconsistent individual who shifts his political
allegiances and criticisms based on his current situation and desires.
Goorukhov is depicted as a self-serving “political dilettante” who
enjoys the trappings of power and uses dramatic gestures and personal
attacks to gain attention. He is characterized as a “nervous woman” who
engages in elaborate performances and is ultimately a figure of little

<p>
The text critiques the former Minister of Internal Affairs, General
Nikolai Kulikov, portraying him as a manipulative figure who embodies a
fabricated “patriotic consciousness” created and exploited by the
Yeltsin regime. It argues that Kulikov’s public image – particularly his
recent appearance on “Glas Naroda” – is a carefully constructed facade,
masking his role as a careerist who blindly followed orders and
participated in the disastrous Chechen wars. The author accuses Kulikov
of distorting history, offering misleading narratives about his actions,
and ultimately betraying the memory of fallen soldiers. It suggests that
Kulikov represents a corrupt and morally bankrupt segment of the former
elite, now reduced to a parody of military leadership, and contrasts him
with a new generation of Russians who are independent, responsible, and
not subservient to power.

2000-02-21 - <b> Boris Khorev </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of economic policies in Russia,
particularly following the 1990s reforms. It argues that Russia’s
economic problems stem from a fundamental incompatibility with the
global “free market” due to its unique geographical and climatic
challenges. The author contends that attempts to align with Western
economic models have been disastrous, leading to a decline in living
standards and a dependence on external forces.

Key arguments include:

-   **Geographical Limitations:** Russia’s climate and natural resources
    create significant economic disadvantages compared to countries with
    more favorable conditions.
-   **Critique of Reforms:** The author strongly condemns the economic
    reforms of the 1990s, accusing them of prioritizing Western
    interests over Russian needs.
-   **Lack of National Support:** The text emphasizes the need for a
    strong, unified national movement to resist pressure from
    international financial institutions and internal “fifth columns.”
-   **Focus on Practical Solutions:** The author advocates for a
    pragmatic approach that acknowledges Russia’s limitations and
    prioritizes national interests, referencing the concerns raised by
    figures like Nikolai Kondratiev regarding global commodity pricing
    and the challenges of adapting to a global market.

Essentially, the text presents a pessimistic view of Russia’s economic
future unless a radical shift in policy occurs, prioritizing national
resilience and acknowledging inherent limitations.

DEATH AND SPECULATORS
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2000-02-28 - <b> Vladimir Bushin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing, almost obsessive, critique of Anatoly Sobchak’s
death and the surrounding circumstances, delivered in a rambling,
polemic style. It argues that Sobchak’s death was not a natural one, but
rather a politically motivated assassination orchestrated by a network
of figures including Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, and various
journalists and political commentators. The author contends that Sobchak
was a deeply flawed and self-serving figure who cultivated a false image
of European sophistication and used this to manipulate others.

The piece relentlessly attacks Sobchak’s character, portraying him as
arrogant, manipulative, and ultimately responsible for his own demise
due to his reckless behavior and disregard for his health. It highlights
a series of events surrounding Sobchak’s death – including his three
heart attacks, his attempts to revive his political career, and the
media frenzy that followed – as evidence of a deliberate plot.

The author uses a sarcastic and often repetitive tone, frequently
invoking historical parallels (particularly referencing Lenin’s critique
of liberal intellectuals) to underscore their argument. They repeatedly
question the motives of those involved, suggesting a cynical
manipulation of public opinion and a calculated effort to discredit
Sobchak. The text is filled with accusations of “political
assassination,” “manipulation,” and “false narratives,” ultimately
concluding that Sobchak’s death was a consequence of his own actions and
the machinations of those seeking to exploit his demise for political
gain. It’s a highly critical and somewhat paranoid reflection on the
events surrounding Sobchak’s death, framed as a warning against the
dangers of political manipulation and the exploitation of public
tragedy.

This text is a series of interviews conducted by journalist Евгений
Храмцов with women involved in the 247th Stavropol Cossack Ranger
Division’s operation in Chechnya during March 2000. The interviews
highlight the diverse roles these women played, ranging from medical
personnel (Captain Elena Banshikova and Sergeant-Telegraphist Olga
Dedeyko) to logistical support and even frontline combat support.

The core theme is the unexpected strength, resilience, and humanity
displayed by these women amidst the brutal realities of war. They
demonstrate unwavering dedication to their duties, often exceeding
expectations and displaying remarkable courage and compassion. Several
women, including medics and a photojournalist, express a profound sense
of duty and a desire to help those in need, regardless of their
nationality or background.

The interviews reveal a surprisingly egalitarian and supportive
environment within the unit, with a focus on mutual respect and a shared
commitment to their mission. The women’s perspectives challenge
traditional notions of femininity in wartime, portraying them as
capable, resourceful, and deeply committed individuals. The piece
emphasizes their unwavering spirit and the enduring human connection
they maintained despite the extreme circumstances.

</p>
<p>
This text describes the ancient Russian tradition of Maslenitsa, a
10-day period preceding Lent. It details the various customs and rituals
associated with Maslenitsa, which evolved over centuries. Initially, it
began with a royal procession and “Judgment Day” spectacle, followed by
a chaotic “rolling flood” across the land. The central figure was a
drunken old man on a sleigh, representing Maslenitsa herself,
accompanied by a bear or bull and often a straw effigy. Specific
traditions included baking “blini” (pancakes) – particularly on Monday
with a special “star-soaked” batter – and elaborate public festivities
like swings, ice mountains, and performances by traveling entertainers.
The week was structured with specific days dedicated to courtship
(Tuesday), lavish treats for sons-in-law (Wednesday), wrestling matches
(Thursday), intimate evenings with mothers-in-law (Friday), and a final
farewell with a burning of the Maslenitsa effigy and seeking forgiveness
(Sunday). The text also mentions a “German Maslenitsa” – a boisterous
indulgence of leftover food and drink, particularly among the
Zhidin-krokhobor people. Ultimately, Maslenitsa was seen as a joyful
transition, a “spring-like” period leading up to the solemnity of Great
Lent and the anticipation of Easter.

This text expresses a deeply pessimistic view of Russia’s potential
entry into NATO, framing it as a catastrophic event with dire

mislead the West, has inadvertently paved the way for a complete
geopolitical takeover by NATO. The author predicts a series of
escalating events: former Soviet republics will rapidly join NATO,
surrendering Russian military bases and allowing foreign troop
deployments, particularly in strategically important regions like the
Black Sea. Ultimately, the author fears that Russia will be reduced to a
vulnerable state, with NATO forces stationed close to its borders, and
that ethnic cleansing and foreign occupation will follow, rendering
Russia’s sacrifices meaningless. The text suggests a clear continuity of
disastrous policy from previous figures like Kozhrev, portraying Putin

<p>
2000-03-13 - <b> Aleksandr Prokhanov </b>
</p>
<p>

This lengthy text is a complex and highly symbolic exploration of
Russian identity, spirituality, and resistance, primarily through the
lens of a fictional figure named Vladimir Lituchin. Lituchin is
portrayed as a mystical, almost mythical, figure who embodies a deep
connection to the Russian soul and a resistance against encroaching
darkness – both literal and metaphorical.

The text describes Lituchin as a healer and a guide, offering solace and
renewed strength to those disillusioned and oppressed. He operates
outside of conventional systems, embodying a primal, almost pagan,
spirituality rooted in the Russian landscape and its history. He’s
depicted as a counterpoint to the perceived corruption and spiritual
emptiness of the modern world, offering a path back to a lost, idealized
Russia.

The narrative utilizes rich imagery – of landscapes, animals, and
symbolic actions – to convey Lituchin’s role as a protector and a source
of hope. His actions, such as guiding a group of dissidents after the
1993 coup attempt, are presented as deeply meaningful and
transformative.

Ultimately, the text suggests that Lituchin represents a fundamental,
enduring aspect of the Russian spirit – a capacity for resilience,
faith, and a profound connection to the natural world. The story
concludes with a vivid, almost dreamlike, description of Lituchin’s
presence, emphasizing his profound connection to the Russian landscape
and his ability to offer solace and renewal.

<p>
The text explores two dominant trends in contemporary art and culture:
technocentrism and biocentrism (nature-centrism). Technocentrism,
exemplified by genres like techno-thrillers (featuring films like
“Terminator” and “The Matrix”), reflects a shift where technology is
valued over humanity, with machines surpassing human capabilities.
Biocentrism, conversely, emphasizes the importance of nature, seen in
works like Chingiz Aitmatov’s “White Nights” and popular games like
“Evolution,” which promote identifying with natural processes. The
“Matrix” film is presented as a particularly striking example, where a
struggle for authentic existence relies on faith rather than traditional
humanism. Both trends represent a departure from anthropocentrism,
seeking value outside of human perception.

coercive interrogation following his arrest at the Begovaya metro
station while meeting with his wife, who was detained by the FSB’s

Muammar Gaddafi argued that political struggles resulting in a victory
for a candidate with, for example, 51% of the vote, inevitably lead to a
“false democracy” and dictatorship. This occurs because the 49% of
voters who did not support the winning candidate are effectively ruled
by it, despite not having voted for it. He believed these political

This text analyzes the consolidation of power in Russia, specifically
focusing on the manipulation of regional governors (“red” and “green”
factions) through financial control and strategic pressure. It argues
that Moscow systematically dismantled regional autonomy by controlling
the flow of funds and exploiting divisions among governors. The text
highlights how regional leaders, initially presenting as champions of
traditional values, were ultimately “ground down” into compliant figures
through a combination of intimidation, disinformation, and the strategic
use of “common European space” – effectively, integration into a
centralized system. The author suggests that this process, driven by a
deliberate strategy of control, has resulted in the erosion of regional
identities and the acceptance of Moscow’s dominance.

Who is Saddam Hussein obstructing?

<p>
2000-04-17 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of a newly published book about Saddam
Hussein, authored by Robin J. Apdyke. The author, Sergey Zhuravlev,
argues that the book is deliberately biased and propagandistic,
reflecting a Western strategy to undermine Russia’s relationship with
Iraq.

Zhuraevlev details several key criticisms of the book: its fabricated
author identity, its distorted presentation of facts, and its consistent
demonization of Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi people. He highlights the
book’s tendency to selectively highlight negative events while ignoring
positive developments in Iraq, such as economic prosperity and social
reforms, which were facilitated by Saddam Hussein’s policies.

Specifically, the book is accused of minimizing the number of civilian
casualties in the Al-Amriya bombing (claiming approximately 300 deaths
instead of the estimated 2,000) and portraying Iraqi actions as
deliberately provocative to incite a Western attack. The author points
out a pattern of Western media bias, where negative events involving
Russia are amplified while positive developments are ignored, and he
connects this to the book’s purpose – to damage Russia’s ties with Iraq.

Finally, Zhuravlev emphasizes the historical context of Russia’s
economic relationship with Iraq, noting that Russia had been paying for
its oil imports in Iraqi currency, and that Western sanctions had
effectively cut off this vital trade, leaving Russia with a significant
debt. He concludes by asserting that the book is a deliberate attempt to
sabotage the burgeoning positive relationship between Russia and Iraq.

</p>
<p>
The text warns of a renewed wave of foreign bank influence in Russia,
primarily driven by institutions like “Indosuez”, “Credit Agricole
Indosuez”, “JP Morgan”, and “Bank of New York,” who previously exploited
Russia’s financial system through the GKO (State Bond Fund) and
subsequent financial schemes. These banks, facilitated by figures like
Yegor Chubais, have historically profited from Russia’s economic
instability, including the 1998 default and the collapse of the Russian
banking system. The current situation involves foreign banks seeking to
re-enter the Russian market under favorable terms, potentially leading
to further exploitation of Russian citizens, particularly depositors of
“Russian Credit,” who are owed substantial sums. The text criticizes the
Central Bank of Russia for facilitating this return and highlights the
ongoing role of “Indosuez” in manipulating Russian finances and exerting
influence through strategic investments and connections with key
figures. It calls for resistance from the Duma and the defrauded
depositors to prevent further financial losses.

Internal power struggles within Russia are prominent, with various

Березовский-Abramovich-Mamut group, Shoygu’s group, Putin’s inner

for influence around the new president. Putin is attempting to manage
these competing interests and is considering drastic measures, such as
reviewing the presidential election results. His trip to London was
unproductive, with strained relations with European partners and a cold

particularly the potential for a crisis similar to 1998, is a concern,
with Russia potentially being targeted. Internal unrest in Armenia,
fueled by communist movements, is influencing Kremlin policy. The
appointment of Chernomyrdin as a special representative for gas

<p>

This text presents a critical assessment of the trajectory of the 20th
century and offers a perspective on the challenges and potential
directions for the 21st. It argues that the “end of history” predicted
by Fukuyama never materialized, and that the rise of neoliberalism and
consumerism have created significant problems – including growing
inequality, environmental degradation, and social fragmentation.

The author synthesizes numerous viewpoints, including those of
economists like Pérez-Guerrero and sociologists like Aveniu,
highlighting concerns about the dominance of market forces and the
potential for social unrest. It explores various proposed solutions,
ranging from the “new socialism” envisioned by figures like Kostopolous,
to the continued evolution of social democratic models, and the
importance of prioritizing social justice and environmental
sustainability.

Several key themes emerge: the need for a shift in values away from
unchecked consumption and towards greater social responsibility, the
importance of knowledge and innovation as drivers of progress, and the
potential for a more decentralized and participatory form of governance.
The text suggests that the future of humanity hinges on resolving the
tension between individual freedom and collective well-being, and on
embracing a vision of development that is both economically viable and
ecologically sustainable. It concludes with a call for a renewed
commitment to social justice and environmental stewardship, recognizing
that the challenges of the 21st century demand a fundamentally different
approach than those that have shaped the world thus far.

The text criticizes the transfer of a valuable collection of artworks

This text details the 2000 hostage situation in Ratchaburi, Thailand,
involving a group calling themselves “The Army of God,” led by teenage
twin brothers, Johnny and Luther Tu. The group, comprised of Burmese
Karens (primarily young boys, many under 12) fighting alongside the
twins, had seized a hospital and demanded passage to Burma. The
narrative highlights the unusual circumstances: the small size of the
group, the age of the leaders, and the seemingly reasonable demands of
the “soldiers.”

The text emphasizes the group’s unexpected defiance and the perceived
absurdity of the situation, drawing parallels to historical figures and
concepts like the “infancy of the world” and the idea of
“un-specialized” potential. It explores the concept of “nonoteny” – the
idea that humans retain a childlike capacity for innovation and
disruption – and suggests that the teenagers’ actions represent a
challenge to established societal norms and power structures.

The hostage situation was ultimately resolved with the deaths of nine of
the teenagers and the disappearance of the tenth, but the text frames
this outcome as a consequence of the group’s refusal to conform and
their unwavering belief in their cause. The final lines suggest that
this event is merely the beginning of a larger, potentially disruptive,

This lengthy text details the highly controversial and ultimately unjust
trial of 15 Russian citizens, dubbed the “Pugachev group,” arrested in
Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan, in 1999. The arrests stemmed from a failed
attempt by a group of Russian citizens to leave the region, and the
subsequent trial was widely perceived as a politically motivated show
trial orchestrated by Kazakh authorities, particularly President
Nazarbayev.

The trial was characterized by numerous irregularities and abuses. The
defendants were subjected to torture, intimidation, and fabricated
charges of terrorism and conspiracy. The legal process was severely
compromised, with limited access for defense attorneys, a biased judge
(M. Kislova), and a prosecutor who aggressively pursued the case. The
defendants were effectively denied due process and fair representation.

The text highlights the involvement of various external actors,
including the US Congress (particularly after a visit by FBI Director
Robert Mueller), which pressured Kazakhstan, and the Russian government,
which largely remained silent despite the blatant injustices. The trial
was fueled by a complex web of geopolitical tensions and historical
grievances.

The trial’s outcome was predetermined, with the defendants convicted
despite a lack of credible evidence. The text emphasizes the systematic
denial of consular protection to the Russian citizens and the disregard
for international norms and agreements. The situation culminated in
widespread protests in Russia, involving various patriotic and
nationalist groups, further demonstrating the outrage over the
injustice. The text concludes with a chilling assessment of the

report on the “National Costume-2000” exhibition in Moscow. It details
the efforts of Vyacheslav Zaitsev and Andrei Parakhin to revive and
promote traditional Russian clothing, portraying it as a crucial element
of Russian identity and a burgeoning business opportunity. The piece is
filled with colorful characters – from the eccentric Zaitsev to the
young designer, Arseny Andreevich – and a strong sense of nostalgia for
a perceived lost cultural heritage.

The exhibition itself is depicted as a bizarre mix of elements: a
Soviet-era spectacle, a showcase of folk costumes, and a surprisingly
modern attempt to revive traditional Russian fashion. There’s a critique
of contemporary fashion trends – particularly the perceived vulgarity of
Western styles – and a belief that traditional clothing can restore a
sense of national pride and order.

Zaitsev, a key figure, is presented as a visionary obsessed with fashion
and deeply connected to Russian history and culture. He sees the revival
of traditional clothing as a way to combat a perceived cultural decline
and a vital step in restoring Russia’s place in the world. The text
emphasizes the importance of preserving and promoting this heritage,
suggesting it’s not just a matter of aesthetics but a crucial element of
national identity and economic opportunity. The piece concludes with a

This text critiques the “Strategy for the Development of the Russian
Federation until 2010” proposed by Herman Gref and his Center for
Strategic Research (CSR). The strategy, presented as a roadmap for
Russia’s economic development, is portrayed as a thinly veiled attempt
to further integrate Russia into the global capitalist system, primarily
benefiting Western corporations and oligarchs.

The core argument is that the strategy is fundamentally flawed and
ultimately detrimental to Russia’s long-term interests. It relies on a
series of questionable assumptions, including a rapid and unsustainable
economic growth driven by increased private investment and deregulation
– a model that has historically proven problematic for Russia.

Specifically, the text highlights several concerns: the strategy’s
emphasis on a “civilized” world, mirroring the post-World War II
rhetoric of the West; the potential for increased authoritarianism and
the suppression of dissent through the expansion of security forces; and
the overall prioritization of Western interests over Russia’s own.

The author argues that the strategy is a carefully crafted illusion,
designed to mislead the Russian public while serving the agenda of those
seeking to exploit Russia’s resources and markets. It’s presented as a
path towards economic growth, but ultimately, it’s seen as a recipe for
further dependence on the West and a decline in Russia’s sovereignty.

The article details the ongoing, highly unstable situation in Chechnya
as of June 6, 2000. The conflict is characterized by sporadic,
unpredictable guerilla warfare against Russian forces, with significant
casualties on both sides. Russian forces are experiencing substantial
losses, particularly due to mine-laying tactics employed by the Chechen
militants.

The Chechen militants are heavily reliant on external support, primarily
through supply routes established in Ingushetia and coordinated by
Ukraine and Georgia. They are actively recruiting fighters from Ukraine,
Azerbaijan, and other countries, utilizing training centers and
employing a network of smuggling routes. A key strategic shift involves
a proposed, Kremlin-backed negotiation plan contingent on the
elimination of key Chechen leaders like Basayev and Khashimov.

The situation is further complicated by Russian counter-operations near
the Dagestan border and the disruption of potential border crossings.
The article highlights the deteriorating effectiveness of the
Basayev-led forces, particularly following the dismissal of the former
mayor of Grozny, and the ongoing efforts to dismantle their networks.
The overall outlook is bleak, predicting a “hot, stormy, and bloody”

This text details the increasingly unstable political situation in
Tajikistan, particularly following the 2000 elections and the ongoing
tensions between the ruling government of President Rahmonov and the
opposition, primarily led by figures like Mahmoud Khodzhayev and
Salamsho Mukhabatov. The core issue is the deeply fractured political
landscape, fueled by past civil war remnants, corruption, and the
influence of powerful figures like the “Kulabs” and “Vovchis.”

The text highlights several key factors contributing to this
instability: the lack of a clear political leader within the opposition,
the significant economic influence of narcotics trafficking
(particularly heroin) – a major industry controlled by figures within
both the government and the opposition – and the potential for a wider
conflict involving the Taliban and Afghan forces. The presence of the
201st Motor Rifle Division, increasingly viewed as ineffective and
demoralized, further exacerbates the situation.

The text paints a picture of a country on the brink of civil war, with
Russia’s role becoming increasingly ambiguous, potentially abandoning
its military presence in Tajikistan and leaving the country vulnerable
to external forces, particularly Turkey and the Taliban. The author
suggests a likely escalation of conflict within months, driven by the

and psychologically intense encounter, exploring themes of captivity,
resilience, and the struggle against overwhelming odds, culminating in a
moment of apparent surrender and a shift in Klyuchkov’s perception of
reality.

The arrest of media mogul Gusinsky was primarily driven by the “economic
aspect,” fueled by jealousy from around-the-clock oligarchs like
Березовский, Абрамоvič, and Мамут. This “economic aspect” was part of a
broader “third oligarchic war” involving competing factions of Russian
capital. One group, supporting Gusinsky, advocated for unrestrained
national wealth exploitation, while the other sought to consolidate
state power through large, centralized holdings, opposing
decentralization. The conflict stemmed from a fundamental ideological
difference regarding Russia’s future, representing a generational
struggle between different approaches to controlling the country’s
resources and governance.

The text is a scathing critique of NTV’s coverage of the Chechen wars,
delivered by a wounded veteran. The author recounts experiences meeting
with a fellow soldier and details how NTV consistently portrayed
Russians negatively, exploiting the suffering of Chechen civilians and
soldiers. He argues that NTV’s reporting was manipulative propaganda,
prioritizing sensationalism and fueling hatred rather than providing
accurate information. The author uses specific examples from both wars,
highlighting NTV’s focus on portraying Russians as weak and criminals,
while simultaneously exploiting the deaths of Russian soldiers. He
accuses NTV of being a major form of betrayal, comparing its actions to
the failings of “Советское информбюро” during World War II, and

The text expresses deep skepticism regarding the ongoing “reforms” in

contends that the scale of investment required to transition to a

This text is a firsthand account of the extensive and dangerous work of
Russian sappers (military engineers specializing in explosive ordnance
disposal) during the 2000-2001 Chechen conflict, specifically focusing
on the clearing of Grozny. It’s a gritty, realistic portrayal of the
challenges and risks involved in removing landmines, grenades, and other
explosive devices from the heavily contaminated city.

The narrative is delivered through the perspective of a journalist
interviewing several key figures – primarily the commanders of sapper
units – offering a detailed look at the scale of the operation. It
highlights the immense quantity of explosive materials left behind by
both sides, emphasizing the prolonged and complex nature of the task.
The text details the specific units involved, their operational areas
(Grozny, Komyske, etc.), and the sheer volume of ordnance – over 10,000
items – that were neutralized by the sappers.

Beyond the logistical challenges, the piece emphasizes the ongoing
threat posed by “black Abdullahs” – Chechen militants who continued to
lay new traps and improvised explosive devices even after the main
fighting had subsided. It underscores the constant vigilance required
and the fact that the sappers were essentially fighting a war against a
persistent enemy, even after the city was ostensibly “cleared.” The text
also touches on the psychological impact of the work, the reliance on
experience and intuition, and the fatalistic acceptance of the inherent
risks. The final lines reflect the cyclical nature of the conflict and
the ongoing need for these specialized engineers.

</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy interview with writer Vadim Kozhinov reflecting
on the 20th century, particularly Russia’s role within it. Kozhinov
argues that the 20th century, despite its tragedies and challenges,
ultimately represents a period of profound significance for Russia,
marked by resilience and eventual triumph. He rejects a purely negative
assessment, emphasizing that Russia’s struggles – including periods of
intense suffering and political upheaval – ultimately shaped its
identity and eventual success.

Kozhinov frames the 20th century as a cyclical process, where Russia
repeatedly faced adversity, only to emerge stronger. He draws parallels
between historical figures like Marshall Rokossovsky and Sergei Korolev,
who endured hardship and ultimately achieved greatness, and argues that
Russia’s history is defined by this pattern of suffering and eventual
achievement.

He expresses skepticism about the future of historical narratives,
anticipating attempts by Western historians to erase Russia’s
significance from the historical record. He also offers a critical
perspective on the Soviet era, acknowledging its flaws but asserting
that Russia’s historical trajectory is inextricably linked to its
ability to overcome challenges. Kozhinov emphasizes the importance of
understanding Russia’s history not as a simple tale of misfortune, but
as a story of enduring strength and ultimately, a triumph of the Russian
spirit. He concludes with a cautionary note about the dangers of
simplistic historical interpretations and the need to recognize the
complex and often contradictory nature of Russia’s past.

BUSINESSMEN WITHOUT APRONS
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2000-07-31 - <b> Boris Aleksandrov </b>
</p>
<p>

The August 1, 2000, meeting between President Putin and “businessmen
without diapers” was a carefully orchestrated event designed primarily
for Putin’s external image rather than genuine reform. Initially, the
meeting aimed to reassure Western investors and the public about
Russia’s commitment to a market economy, countering anxieties
surrounding the arrest of figures like Gusinsky and accusations of
illegal privatization. Putin’s goal was to project an image of a leader
embracing business while simultaneously controlling it.

However, the participants – a mix of prominent businessmen, liberal
politicians like Nemtsov, and political figures – were largely
uncoordinated and driven by their own agendas. Nemtsov sought to
position himself as a key mediator between Putin and the business elite,
hoping to secure funding for his “Right Eagle” bloc. Putin, in turn,
attempted to demonstrate “equality” with all business interests, a
tactic that ultimately proved superficial.

The meeting’s outcome was largely symbolic. Putin promised not to revise
privatization results, a pledge that many business leaders immediately
interpreted differently. He demanded reduced personal consumption from
the business sector, but offered no concrete guarantees.

Ultimately, the meeting was a carefully constructed performance, with
Putin skillfully managing the optics while failing to address the
underlying issues of corruption and unequal power dynamics. Nemtsov’s
attempts to shape the event backfired, and the business leaders left
with little more than a promise of continued control, rather than
genuine support. The meeting’s conclusion, with Nemtsov’s famously
dismissive remark about leaving “without diapers,” highlighted the
fundamental disconnect between Putin’s intentions and the realities of
Russia’s business landscape.

This text details the complex and multifaceted folklore surrounding Ilya
Perfetsiy (Ilya the Thunderboar), a figure central to Slavic pagan
traditions, particularly concerning weather and protection from evil.
Historically, Ilya was revered as a powerful figure who controlled
storms, lightning, and rain, often depicted riding a fiery chariot.
Beliefs surrounding him varied regionally, notably with a Serbian
counter-belief that invoking a cross during a thunderstorm was
dangerous. He was seen as both destructive (causing fires and storms)
and creative (bringing life-giving rain) and was associated with a
strict, ascetic lifestyle, requiring fasting and the removal of luxury
items. His influence extended to agricultural practices, with rain
considered essential for fertility, and his day marked a transition from
summer to winter, mirroring the shift associated with Ivan Kupala. The
text highlights the connection between Ilya and the figure of John the
Baptist, and ultimately positions him as a key figure within Slavic
esotericism, as explored in Alexander Dugin’s “Order of Ilya.”

<p>

This text is a detailed analysis of the Russian military’s involvement
in the First Chechen War (1999-2000), highlighting the significant
failures and shortcomings that contributed to the conflict’s protracted
nature and heavy casualties. The core argument is that Russia’s defeat
was largely due to a combination of outdated military equipment,
inadequate funding for modernization, and a failure to adequately
prepare for the specific challenges of the Chechen conflict.

Specifically, the text identifies several key issues: a severe lack of
modern reconnaissance and surveillance equipment (no night-vision
devices, limited drones, poor communications), outdated weaponry
(particularly tanks and artillery), and insufficient funding for
military modernization. The analysis emphasizes that the Russian army
entered the war with a technologically inferior force, relying on
outdated systems and lacking the necessary support equipment to
effectively counter the Chechen resistance.

Furthermore, the text criticizes the political and economic decisions
that led to this situation, pointing to the constraints imposed by the
Soviet-era budget limits and subsequent economic instability. It
underscores the tragic human cost of these failures, with over 2500
Russian soldiers and officers losing their lives.

Finally, the text concludes with a stark warning: without significant
investment in modernizing the military and addressing these systemic
weaknesses, Russia risks repeating the same mistakes and suffering
further losses in future conflicts. It frames the First Chechen War as a
costly and avoidable disaster, a consequence of prioritizing short-term
political goals over long-term military preparedness.

This text recounts a series of encounters with Lazar Borisovich Mekler,
a Soviet scientist who developed “harmonist” theories and pursued them
with a fiercely independent and often critical outlook. Initially,
Mekler proposed radical ideas about manipulating Earth’s orbit and
unlocking the “secret of the gene,” driven by a desire to combat the
emerging threat of AIDS. He sought to align his work with the military,
believing it could serve Russia. Despite his brilliance and connections,
he was rejected by the Soviet system due to his uncompromising
individualism and disdain for the established order.

Years later, Mekler contacted the author, now in Israel, expressing
disillusionment with his experiences and a renewed sense of loyalty to
Russia. He claimed to have discovered the “secret of the human genome”
and lamented the loss of his homeland. His final contact was
particularly striking, revealing a profound shift in his perspective – a
nostalgic yearning for the Soviet Union, articulated through seeking
support from a Russian-language newspaper. The author concludes that
Mekler’s story offers a valuable insight into the evolving attitudes of
Soviet Jews and the potential pitfalls of seeking intellectual
fulfillment outside of a national context.

</p>
<p>

This text is a detailed analysis of the Synod’s decision to canonize the
Romanov family, particularly Tsar Nicholas II and his family. It argues
that the canonization wasn’t driven by political motivations, but rather
by a genuine recognition of the family’s suffering and martyrdom. The
author critiques the prevalent narrative that portrays Nicholas II as a
symbol of a lost, “Romanov” Russia, arguing that he was a surprisingly
humble and aware figure who recognized the impending collapse of that
Russia.

The core argument is that the canonization represents a correction to
historical distortions, acknowledging the family’s tragic fate as a
result of a complex and unavoidable historical moment. The author
highlights the discrepancy between the idealized “Romanov” Russia of the
20th century and the reality of the Tsar’s personal views and the
circumstances of his death.

The text emphasizes the importance of viewing the canonization as a
restorative act, marking a shift away from politically charged
interpretations and towards a sincere recognition of the family’s
sacrifice. It also criticizes the tendency to use the Romanov’s death to
fuel political arguments, particularly the persistent portrayal of
Nicholas II as a symbol of a failed “Romanov” Russia. The author

operation from a nearby cruiser. Initially, the operation is hampered by
a severe storm, limited equipment, and communication difficulties,
particularly the inability to successfully dock with the damaged
submarine. The constant threat of drowning and the psychological strain

and observations – the suffocating cold, the disorientation, the fading
memories, and the overwhelming sense of hopelessness.

Despite these challenges, Shurygin relentlessly pursues every possible
avenue for rescue, coordinating with various support teams, including
Norwegian divers, and issuing repeated SOS signals. The story builds to
a tense climax as the rescue attempts continue, highlighting the bravery
and resilience of the crew and the immense difficulty of the situation.
Ultimately, the text ends on a note of uncertainty, with Shurygin’s fate

This text is a scathing critique of Russian President Vladimir Putin,
delivered in a highly rhetorical and pessimistic style. It argues that
Putin’s leadership is characterized by profound contradictions and a
destructive trajectory for Russia. The author highlights a series of
conflicting actions and policies, including a mix of traditionalist and
market-oriented approaches, a reliance on dubious advisors (like
Alexander Volkov, “Number 3”), and a failure to address fundamental
economic and social problems.

The core argument is that Putin’s regime is built on a foundation of
corruption, mismanagement, and a deliberate disregard for the country’s
infrastructure, resources, and the well-being of its citizens. The
author expresses concern that this contradictory approach will
ultimately lead to disaster, comparing Putin’s leadership to a

The text warns of a looming crisis, fueled by a disconnect between the
official rhetoric of national greatness and the grim reality of a

The text details a meeting between representatives of NTV, “Media-Most,”
and Gazprom, convened to discuss Media-Most’s debt to Gazprom. The
meeting was characterized by a chaotic and manipulative exchange,
primarily driven by Eugene Kiselyov (NTV’s head) and Alfred Koch
(“Gazprom-Media”), with significant contributions from figures like
Sergei Sokorina, and a series of “independent” lawyers. The discussion
revolved around accusations of financial impropriety, with claims of
corruption and manipulation surrounding the sale of media assets. The
meeting devolved into a spectacle of blame-shifting, with Kiselyov
attempting to portray the situation as a battle for freedom of speech,
while Koch and others highlighted the financial issues. Ultimately, the
meeting concluded with NTV appearing to lose the situation, and a
cynical assessment of Media-Most’s prospects.

This text details a complex and orchestrated conspiracy against Russian
President Vladimir Putin, primarily spearheaded by figures like media
mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, along with support from individuals like Alfred
Koch and Viktor Aven. The core of the plot involved a coordinated effort
to discredit Putin, fueled by a combination of economic pressure, media
manipulation, and political maneuvering. Key elements included the
“Media-Most” holding company, orchestrated deals involving financial
backing and strategic concessions, and the involvement of figures like
Gusinsky, Koch, and Aven. The text highlights a deliberate strategy to
undermine Putin’s authority, utilizing media outlets to spread negative
narratives and create a climate of dissent. It emphasizes the perceived
danger posed by figures like Gusinsky and Koch, who were viewed as more
threatening than previously recognized players. The text describes a

following the Kursk submarine disaster. Ultimately, the text portrays a
sophisticated and deeply entrenched plot, revealing the extent of the
planning and the calculated actions of those involved, suggesting a

The text presents a desperate plea from parents in Surgut, Russia, to
their mayor and regional authorities regarding a severe and escalating
drug crisis. They report a shocking rise in drug addiction and deaths,
particularly among young people, estimating nine out of ten residents
have witnessed the problem firsthand. The parents express frustration
with the lack of action, highlighting the alarming number of deaths –
five to ten young people per month – and the apparent impunity of drug
dealers.

They accuse the mayor of failing to address the issue and criticize the
lack of transparency and information available to the public. The
parents highlight the accessibility of drugs, the involvement of
children in the trade, and the inadequacy of existing responses. They
demand stricter laws, including potentially the death penalty for drug
dealers, and greater government accountability.

The text includes commentary from a regional deputy and a member of the
State Security Council, both expressing concern about the lack of a
national drug safety concept and the potential for widespread death
before such a concept is implemented. They emphasize the need for
decisive action and stricter enforcement.

This text is a fragmented, semi-autobiographical account written by
Julia Ivanova, a retired teacher, detailing her experiences in the early
2000s. She describes a period of economic hardship and disillusionment
following the collapse of the Soviet Union, marked by a shift from
writing to selling flowers to survive. The narrative is chaotic and
episodic, jumping between her flower-selling activities, interactions
with local figures (including a mafia-like group, a veteran, and a
judge), and her increasingly fervent belief in a utopian project called
“Izania.” Izania, conceived as a self-sufficient community based on
spiritual principles, is presented as a response to the perceived
failures of both the old Soviet system and the emerging capitalist one.
The text is characterized by a blend of realism and fantastical
elements, with Ivanova’s experiences often bordering on the absurd,
reflecting her frustration with the complexities of post-Soviet Russia.
Ultimately, the story is a poignant reflection on loss, resilience, and
the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world, punctuated by a
persistent, almost delusional, faith in a better future.

</p>
<p>

This text recounts the frustrating experience of Vladislav Karabanov and
his radio station, “Varyag,” attempting to obtain a broadcast license in
Russia during the early 2000s. The core issue was the Ministry of
Communications, headed by Mikhail Lesin, deliberately obstructing their
efforts, despite support from Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

Karabanov details a series of manipulative tactics employed by Lesin’s
team, including a fabricated “competition” (a “contest”) to steal the
station’s allocated frequency after two years of investment and
development – over $100,000 – in developing it. The author highlights
the team’s frustration with the lack of genuine engagement and the
blatant intellectual dishonesty displayed by figures like Anatoly
Pozner, who demonstrated a shocking lack of knowledge despite using a
scientifically recognized term.

The author argues that Lesin’s actions were driven by a deep-seated
animosity towards Putin and a deliberate undermining of Russian state
interests. The entire process was portrayed as a cynical and politically
motivated scheme, designed to damage the reputation of the Russian
government and ultimately, to prevent “Varyag” from contributing to a
positive narrative about Russia’s maritime history and national
identity.

<p>

This poem is a deeply melancholic and cynical reflection on Ukrainian
identity, history, and the perceived betrayal of ideals. The speaker
expresses a profound sense of disillusionment, fueled by a feeling of
being manipulated and exploited, both historically and in the present.

The poem utilizes a dreamlike, almost hallucinatory tone, portraying a
conversation with a “hut” – a symbol of a corrupted past and a failed
national project. The speaker rails against figures who claim to be
patriots while simultaneously engaging in deceit and corruption. There’s
a strong sense of accusation directed at those who claim to fight for
Ukraine’s freedom, portraying them as hypocritical and self-serving.

The poem is filled with imagery of loss, regret, and a desperate plea
for forgiveness. The speaker’s repeated refrain, “Не прощай, когда сойду
с дороги!” (“Don’t forgive me when I leave the road!”) encapsulates this
desperate need for absolution and highlights a profound sense of guilt
and a fear of judgment.

Ultimately, the poem is a lament for a lost dream, a critique of
national betrayal, and a poignant expression of isolation and
disillusionment within a complex and troubled historical context. It’s a
powerful, if bleak, meditation on the challenges of defining and
preserving national identity.

The text is a 2000 interview with the Palestinian Ambassador to Russia,
discussing the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. The core
argument is that Israel’s actions – including targeting civilians,
employing colonial tactics of occupation and oppression, and utilizing a
propaganda campaign – are fueling the conflict. The Ambassador
emphasizes the disproportionate violence against unarmed Palestinians,
highlighting the loss of life, particularly children, and the
destruction of communities.

He argues that Israel’s actions are driven by a racist ideology and a
desire to maintain control, and that the international community,
particularly the United States, is failing to adequately address the
situation. The Ambassador calls for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli
forces, the cessation of violence, and the establishment of a commission
to investigate Israeli crimes.

He believes Russia needs to assume a more prominent role in mediating
the conflict, recognizing that the current imbalance of power and the
lack of Russian involvement are detrimental to achieving a peaceful
resolution. He stresses the importance of international support and the
need for the Russian people to understand and support the Palestinian
cause.

The text critiques the film “Russian Uprising,” a new adaptation of “The
Captain’s Daughter,” largely due to its misguided title and shallow
execution. It argues that the film, produced by “NTV-profit” and
directed by Proshkin, failed to capture the essence of “Russian
Uprising” – a genuine, collective social movement – instead becoming a
sterile, overly polished, and historically inaccurate melodrama. The
author highlights the film’s reliance on superficial elements like a
flamboyant, poorly realized portrayal of Pugachev and a lack of genuine
thematic engagement with the concept of rebellion. The author suggests
that the film’s failure stemmed from a weak script, a lack of creative
vision, and an inability to translate the complex idea of “Russian
Uprising” into a compelling cinematic experience. Ultimately, the text
concludes that the film’s title and execution were fundamentally flawed,
representing a missed opportunity to explore a powerful historical and

This text is a rambling, cynical, and largely paranoid reflection on
Russian history, power, and corruption, primarily through the lens of a
single narrator’s experiences and observations. It centers around the
recurring figure of “boys with money” – wealthy, often privileged young
men – who appear throughout the narrator’s life, frequently associated
with wealth, influence, and ultimately, death.

The narrator details a series of encounters with figures like Temir
Borovik, Konstantin Ernst, and others, portraying them as a parasitic
class feeding off the country’s resources and exploiting connections. He
expresses a deep-seated class resentment, blaming these “boys with
money” for a range of societal ills and attributing numerous deaths to
their greed and influence.

The narrative is filled with digressions, tangents, and historical
references (including Dickens and Mishima), often used to illustrate his
points or to express his frustration with the corruption he perceives.
He frequently resorts to hyperbole and exaggeration, creating a darkly
humorous and unsettling portrait of Russia’s elite and its impact on the
lives of ordinary people. The text ultimately suggests a bleak view of
Russian history and a profound distrust of those in positions of power.

Michael Lubimov and Alexander Prokhanov discuss the existence of large
Soviet projects like “Operation Golgotha” and Putin’s rise, framing it
as a manipulation of perceptions and a reflection of historical
tendencies towards grandiose schemes. Lubimov emphasizes his upbringing
within a Soviet mindset predisposed to believing in large projects,
highlighting how these schemes were often driven by personal or group
interests rather than genuine goals. He recounts anecdotes from his time
in the KGB, including a story about destroying a translation of an
anti-Soviet article by Finshow, and another about the suppression of
information regarding the internal situation in the USSR.

Lubimov attributes the apparent “happiness” he observes in contemporary
Russia to a natural selection process, where individuals less driven by
materialistic desires and more by a sense of freedom and national pride
are thriving. He contrasts this with the perceived failings of Western
societies, citing their internal divisions and anxieties. He suggests
that Russia’s current situation represents a necessary, albeit painful,
step towards a new, more resilient civilization, and that the West’s
problems stem from their own internal contradictions. He concludes by
expressing a belief that Russia’s future is brighter than that of many
Western nations.

Several participants expressed frustration with the lack of progress

The text recounts a search and rescue operation conducted by the
“Stolitsa” search organization in the Konduya village area of the
Leningrad region in Russia. The group, led by Alexei Voronkov, was part
of the “Memory Watch” initiative, focusing on uncovering remnants of the

and the remains of fallen soldiers.

Over several days, the team discovered a variety of items, including a
German sanitary burial ground containing the remains of approximately
200 soldiers, a large German cooking oven, numerous discarded weapons
and equipment (including a cavalry horn and a machine gun), and a
significant collection of rusted helmets. They meticulously documented
and collected these items, intending to return them to their families or
to a memorial in Kirishi. The operation was challenging due to the

This report summarizes a three-day academic conference titled
“Perspectives on Socialism in Russia” held October 3-4, 2000, which
aimed to reassess the trajectory of Russian thought following the
collapse of the Soviet Union. The conference brought together prominent
Russian intellectuals, including figures like Yuri Osipov, Gennady
Zyuganov, and Boris Khorov, to discuss the challenges facing Russia and
the potential for a “post-socialist” future.

A central theme was the perceived failure of the Yeltsin era and the
need for a new theoretical foundation for Russian society. Many speakers
criticized the lack of engagement with fundamental societal issues and
the prioritization of economic liberalization over social and cultural
values. There was a strong sense of disillusionment with the prevailing
intellectual climate and a desire to reclaim a national identity rooted
in traditional values.

Several speakers expressed skepticism about the possibility of a return
to a socialist model, but emphasized the importance of understanding the
historical roots of the Soviet system and identifying the factors that
contributed to its demise. The conference highlighted a deep concern
about the degradation of the Russian intellectual landscape and the loss
of critical thinking. Many participants felt that the dominant narrative
following the collapse of the USSR had been overly influenced by Western
ideas and had failed to adequately address the specific challenges
facing Russia. There was a call for a renewed focus on national
identity, social justice, and a more sustainable path for economic
development. The conference concluded with a recognition of the need for
a fundamental shift in the country’s intellectual and political
direction.

Bush’s administration is expected to reduce military deployments,

a more assertive stance against Russia, and a significant investment in
developing a national missile defense system, potentially leading to a

This text is a lengthy reflection by the author of the Russian newspaper
“Pech’” (Forge) on the ten years of its publication. It expresses a
deeply rooted belief in the inherent goodness and resilience of the
Russian people, arguing against negative stereotypes often associated
with Russians. The author emphasizes a tenet of the newspaper’s
philosophy: “the people are always right,” regardless of external
judgments.

Throughout the decade, “Pech’” focused on documenting the lives and
struggles of ordinary Russians, particularly in rural areas like Chern

spirit. The newspaper actively supported these individuals, often
intervening in local conflicts and providing assistance.

The author views the newspaper’s role as one of quietly nurturing and
validating the Russian people, recognizing their inherent strength and
ability to overcome adversity. They believe that the Russian people are
fundamentally good, despite the criticisms leveled against them, and
that this inherent goodness is a defining characteristic of the nation.
The text concludes with a reaffirmation of this belief, asserting that

silencing of dissenting voices and the use of increasingly extreme

This text is a firsthand account of a week-long visit to Iran by a

significant change and development, contrasting sharply with the Western
perception of Iran as a hostile and unstable nation. The journalist
highlights several key observations: Iran’s thriving economy, fueled by
its natural resources and burgeoning domestic production, its relatively
high standard of living compared to Russia, and the genuine interest
among Iranians for cooperation with Russia.

The author challenges common Western narratives, emphasizing that Iran
is a dynamic, self-sufficient nation with a growing economy and a desire
for mutually beneficial partnerships. He notes the stark differences in
living standards and economic opportunities, and the lack of Western
influence in Iranian society. The visit reveals a country actively
pursuing its own interests and seeking a more independent role on the
global stage, presenting a complex and nuanced view of Iran that
challenges prevailing stereotypes. The journalist concludes that Iran’s
potential as a partner for Russia is significant, given the shared

This text is a scathing, almost apocalyptic, critique of Saint
Petersburg and its transformation over time. The author argues that the
city, initially built on a brutal foundation of human exploitation and
suffering, has fundamentally corrupted itself. He views the city as a
“machine” fueled by the “living force” of its inhabitants – essentially,
the relentless, often dehumanizing, demands of urban life.

The core argument is that Saint Petersburg’s history is marked by a
cycle of destruction and exploitation, symbolized by the “Copper
Horseman” (the equestrian statue) which represents the city’s imperial
ambitions and the suffering endured to achieve them. The author contends
that the city’s population – represented by figures like Akaky
Akakievich – are essentially expendable “human material” constantly
drained by the city’s insatiable appetite.

He describes the city’s evolution as a process of “killing” the
individual, highlighting the loss of connection to history, culture, and
genuine human connection. The author expresses deep cynicism about the
city’s attempts to cultivate a “culture,” viewing it as a superficial
imitation, a “wax figure” devoid of substance. He sees the city’s
attempts to attract “culture” as a desperate attempt to mask its
underlying corruption and the disappearance of its true inhabitants.

Ultimately, the text is a lament for a lost city, a warning against the
dangers of unchecked ambition and the corrosive effects of urban life,
and a plea to remember and honor the forgotten “little people” who built
and suffered within its walls. The author suggests that the city’s true
character lies not in its grand monuments, but in the enduring spirit of
those who were sacrificed to its glory.
