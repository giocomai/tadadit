Postmodern times
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-01-13 - <b> Vladimir Bondarenko </b>
</p>
<p>
The text is a 1997 analysis of post-modernism in Russia, arguing that it
represents the “end of history” – a state where traditional ideologies,
heroes, and grand narratives have been systematically rejected. The
author contends that Russia, like much of the world, has fallen into
this post-modern condition, characterized by a pervasive sense of irony,
parody, and self-deprecation. Key themes include the dismissal of
historical figures and events, the absence of leadership or decisive
action, and a general lack of belief in any positive future. The author
critiques prominent figures and cultural trends, including the work of
writers like Viktor Astafiev and the rise of a “post-modern” artistic
sensibility. Ultimately, the text expresses concern that Russia is
trapped in this state, with young people increasingly rejecting
post-modern cynicism in favor of a return to heroic ideals and
leadership.

Actor Orlov Vasily
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-01-13 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text explores the legacy of Konstantin Stanislavsky and his
influence on Russian theatre, particularly through the work of actor
Vasily Alexandrovich Orlov. It details Orlov’s exceptional performances,
notably as Kulygin in Chekhov’s plays, highlighting his ability to
embody realistic and complex characters, rejecting rigid “typecasting.”
The text contrasts Stanislavsky’s approach – emphasizing an actor’s
emotional connection and “feeling” as the primary driver of performance
– with the idea that the actor should “go from themselves” to the role.

It emphasizes the importance of Chekhov’s plays and the Theatre Studio’s
(MKhAT) commitment to portraying authentic human experiences. The text
describes the collaborative and almost reverent relationship between
Stanislavsky, Vasily Popov, and Orlov, illustrated by a memorable
backstage encounter. It also outlines the ethical boundaries within
Russian theatre, where characters are protected from external
interference, mirroring the play’s own themes of privacy and inner life.
Finally, it recounts the initial challenges and collaborative spirit
surrounding the revival of Chekhov’s “Kulygin,” emphasizing the unique
and profound connection Orlov forged with the role, solidifying his
status as a pivotal figure in the history of Russian theatre.

1997-01-13 - <b> Anatoliy Afanasʹyev </b>
</p>
<p>
This excerpt from Anatoly Afanasiev’s novel “Shed of the Mind” depicts a
surreal and unsettling encounter within a psychiatric institution. The
story unfolds through the perspective of a man who finds himself
inexplicably admitted to a bleak facility, where he interacts with a
series of bizarre and emotionally detached characters, most notably
Zinaida Petrovna, a nurse with a surprisingly intimate connection to
him. The narrative is characterized by a dreamlike quality, with
illogical events and conversations, highlighting themes of isolation,
disorientation, and the fragility of identity. The encounter with
Zinaida Petrovna is particularly significant, marked by a brief, intense
moment of physical intimacy that further contributes to the story’s
unsettling atmosphere. The excerpt establishes a core conflict – the
protagonist’s struggle to understand his situation and his growing sense
of alienation within this strange environment.

This text, dated January 14, 1997, details a complex web of political
maneuvering and strategic planning surrounding President Yeltsin and the
Russian government. Key themes include intense political consultations
among top officials regarding Yeltsin’s health and potential
constitutional changes. There’s a significant focus on power struggles
within the government, particularly between figures associated with
Yeltsin (like Chubais) and those seeking to influence him (like
Luzkhov).

The text reveals extensive, covert operations orchestrated by American
intelligence agencies, aiming to destabilize governments in Belgrade and
Sofia through “color revolutions.” American financial and corporate
interests are deeply involved in restructuring Russian assets, including
major banks, oil companies, and potentially even satellite and
communications industries.

There’s a concerted effort to discredit and remove Yeltsin from power,
fueled by anxieties about Russian nationalism and the influence of
figures like Korzhakov. The text highlights a coordinated campaign of
disinformation and propaganda, supported by both American and Russian
actors, with the goal of manipulating public opinion and shaping
political outcomes. Finally, it suggests a planned, and potentially
orchestrated, shift in Russian policy, including a possible agreement
with NATO and a strategy to preempt constitutional changes driven by
Yeltsin’s declining health.

</p>
<p>

The text recounts the final moments of Major Razin, a fighter pilot, who
deliberately crashed his plane into the banks of the Moscow River during
a training flight. Initially, Razin experienced a surge of patriotic
fervor and a sense of fulfilling his duty for Russia and his people,
fueled by the impending mission. However, a deep-seated anxiety and
concern persisted, highlighted by his close relationship with Captain
Pugachev and his family, including Razin’s children, Igor and Marina.

As the flight progressed, Razin’s thoughts turned to the potential
consequences of his actions, particularly regarding his family’s future
and the impact on his children. He wrestled with the realization that
his actions would likely lead to further suffering and hardship for
them.

Ultimately, Razin made the fateful decision to crash his plane, driven
by a desperate desire to prevent further harm and a profound sense of
disillusionment with the situation. The text concludes with the official
recognition of Razin’s bravery and sacrifice, despite the tragic outcome
of his actions.

</p>
<p>

This text recounts the author’s experiences as a writer in the Soviet
Union from the late 1960s through the 1980s, focusing on the insidious
influence of Western culture and, more significantly, the deliberate
manipulation of Soviet society by pro-Western forces. The narrative
details a concerted effort, allegedly orchestrated by figures like Allen
Dulles, to undermine the USSR through the introduction of
“pseudo-culture,” primarily American popular culture, and the
infiltration of Soviet institutions by agents of influence, including
Jewish intellectuals and figures associated with organizations like
Mossad.

The author describes a climate of ideological struggle, fueled by a
perceived “cultural invasion” and the actions of “agents of influence”
within the Communist Party and cultural organizations. He details his
own attempts to resist this influence, alongside other writers who
opposed the “consolidation” policy imposed by the Soviet leadership,
which he viewed as a surrender to Western pressure. He recounts a
specific incident involving a letter he drafted criticizing the
situation, which was intercepted by the Committee for State Security
(KGB) and subsequently used to discredit him and other dissenting
writers.

The narrative highlights the author’s frustration with the manipulation
of public opinion, the suppression of genuine artistic expression, and
the pervasive presence of pro-Western ideologies within the Soviet
cultural landscape. He describes a complex web of relationships and
betrayals, involving figures within the Communist Party, the KGB, and
various cultural organizations, all seemingly working to undermine the
Soviet Union from within. The text concludes with a reflection on the
ongoing struggle between genuine artistic expression and the forces of
cultural manipulation, and a sobering assessment of the impact of these
forces on Soviet society.

Premiere: The limit of the Russian Revolution has not been reached.
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-02-10 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

The text presents a darkly satirical and paranoid vision of Russia in
1997, suggesting a desperate attempt to prepare for a “Russian
Revolution” – a catastrophic upheaval. It describes a clandestine
operation involving prominent figures (politicians, bankers, media
personalities, military officials) who are secretly relocating to a
massive, custom-built “Ark” (Ковчег) designed to house them and a select
group of individuals in the event of a violent revolution.

The Ark is being financed by major banks and populated with individuals
from various sectors of society, including those considered enemies of
the current regime. The underlying premise is that a popular uprising is
inevitable and that this group is preparing to survive and potentially
rebuild Russia after a violent revolution, possibly even relocating to
Ararat to repopulate.

The text uses vivid, hyperbolic language to depict a deeply distrustful
and volatile atmosphere, fueled by widespread anger and resentment
towards the government. It suggests a sense of impending doom and a
belief that a violent revolution is not just possible, but almost
predetermined, and that the elite are desperately trying to escape its
consequences. The Ark is presented as a last resort, a means of
preserving a select few amidst a chaotic and destructive event.

1997-03-03 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>

The text presents a highly critical and conspiratorial view of events
following the collapse of the Soviet Union, focusing on the roles of
figures like Yegor Gaidar (implied as “Чубайс”), Yevgeny Primakov
(“Черномырдина”), and others in exacerbating economic and social
problems in Russia. It depicts a deliberate plan by these individuals,
aided by bankers and Western influence, to exploit the chaos and
consolidate power, leading to widespread poverty, social unrest, and
ultimately, a new revolutionary upheaval. The author argues that the
public is being manipulated through misinformation and that a genuine
opposition is lacking. The solution proposed is for the people to
directly engage with the issues, bypassing the established political
structures and confronting the perceived oppressors directly. The
overall tone is apocalyptic, suggesting a bleak future for Russia if the
current trajectory continues.

The poem explores themes of loss, memory, and the passage of time
through fragmented imagery and recurring motifs. It depicts a cyclical
existence marked by fleeting moments, fading memories, and a sense of
impending doom. The speaker experiences a series of brief encounters – a
dying fire, a cold night, a lonely mother, and ultimately, a return to a
familiar, yet ultimately empty, routine. Recurring elements like the
moon, rain, and the sound of a harmonica suggest a relentless,
melancholic journey. The poem culminates in a final farewell,
emphasizing the inevitability of endings and the desire for connection

</p>
<p>

This text is a highly fragmented and speculative collection of
intelligence reports and analyses circulating in the Russian political
landscape in early 1997. It details a complex web of power struggles
within the Yeltsin administration, primarily between factions led by
figures like Anatoly Chubais and Boris Yeltsin himself, alongside
external actors like Gorbachev, and foreign intelligence services,
particularly those of Turkey and Iran.

The core narrative revolves around a deliberate effort to destabilize
Russia and divide it along ethnic and regional lines. This is being
orchestrated through a combination of political manipulation,
disinformation campaigns, and the promotion of separatist agendas. Key
elements include:

-   **Power Struggles:** Intense infighting within the Russian
    government, driven by personal ambitions, ideological differences,
    and control over resources.
-   **External Interference:** Active involvement of foreign
    intelligence services (Turkey, Iran, Germany) in supporting
    separatist movements and undermining Russian sovereignty.
-   **Separatist Agendas:** Promotion of separatist movements in the
    Caucasus and Central Asia, aiming to create a new “Caucasian
    Confederation” with potential ties to Turkey and Ukraine.
-   **Economic Manipulation:** Plans to exploit Russia’s economic
    vulnerabilities, including the potential for currency devaluation
    and the redirection of energy resources.
-   **Geopolitical Strategy:** A broader strategy to weaken Russia’s
    influence in the region and potentially recreate elements of the
    Soviet Union through a federalized structure.

The reports are characterized by a lack of verifiable facts and rely
heavily on “agent-sourced information,” suggesting a climate of paranoia
and mistrust. The overall tone is one of alarm, portraying Russia as
vulnerable to external manipulation and internal fragmentation.

</p>
<p>
The text describes a cynical and politically charged scenario involving
key figures in post-Soviet Russia – Nemyotov, Chubais, and Chernomyrdin
– and a system of “shunts” (organ transplants) used to influence and
control the government. Nemyotov, a rising political figure, is being
strategically “donated” to the government through these transplants to
gain power, while Chubais, representing banking capital, and the
increasingly weakened Chernomyrdin, representing a reformed, but still
manipulated, system, are being managed through this process. The
“shunts” are likened to a draining of resources from the new government,
with the older “shunts” failing and new ones being introduced with a
two-year lifespan. The text portrays a power struggle, highlighting the
manipulation and control exerted by Chubais and the strategic use of
Nemyotov, alongside the declining influence of Chernomyrdin and the
chaotic attempts to stabilize the economy.

FLASH AND NOTHING CENTRAL BANK
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-03-24 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, written in 1997, details the economic situation in Russia,
primarily focusing on the role and challenges of the Central Bank (ЦБ)
and the Ministry of Finance (Минфин). It highlights a series of
interconnected issues including the problematic use of векселя (bills of
exchange), the influence of foreign models (particularly the British and
American), and the deep-seated economic crisis.

The core argument is that the Central Bank, under the leadership of S.
Dubinin, is failing to effectively address the crisis due to its
reliance on outdated, simplistic techniques – primarily selling rubles
for dollars – and its inability to fully develop a functioning domestic
market. The reliance on векселя, coupled with the dominance of imports
and a struggling export sector, creates a precarious situation.

Several key points are made: the Ministry of Finance is struggling with
a severe budget deficit, the Central Bank is hampered by a lack of
authority and influence, and the broader economic landscape is
characterized by a lack of dynamism and a reliance on foreign models
that aren’t suited to Russia’s circumstances.

The text suggests two potential solutions: a drastic reduction in
government spending or a concerted effort to develop a robust internal
market, with the Central Bank playing a crucial role in establishing a
functioning domestic currency system – essentially, a second
“Mongolfier” to support domestic demand. Finally, the text proposes a
new approach for the opposition, suggesting they should actively
challenge the government’s policies, but only if the Central Bank is
simultaneously taking steps to foster a thriving internal market.

The text is a satirical critique of Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
comparing him unfavorably to Peter the Great. It argues that Yeltsin has
dismantled the achievements of Peter the Great, squandering Russia’s
wealth, destroying industry and culture, and generally behaving as a
corrupt and incompetent ruler. The comparison is made through vivid,
often absurd imagery – Yeltsin is depicted as a fraudulent imitation of
Peter, with a decaying, worthless costume, a plastic throne, and a
hollow, empty personality. The text emphasizes the contrast between
Peter’s ambitious, transformative actions and Yeltsin’s perceived

</p>
<p>

This transcript, delivered by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is a scathing
critique of Boris Yeltsin’s leadership and the state of Russia in the
1990s. Zhirinovsky argues that Yeltsin’s government is riddled with
corruption, incompetence, and a deliberate disregard for the well-being
of the Russian people. He uses a series of specific examples – including
the “boy” (a young man who appeared to support Yeltsin), the economic
mismanagement of the Nizhny Novgorod region, the collapse of industries
like the Sormovsky shipyard, rising crime rates, drug addiction, and the
manipulation of statistics – to illustrate his claims.

Zhirinovsky accuses Yeltsin’s inner circle – a network of “Boris”
figures – of actively benefiting from the country’s decline,
highlighting instances of embezzlement and the suppression of political
opposition, exemplified by the imprisonment of businessman Klementyev.
He suggests a deliberate conspiracy to protect these figures and
maintain control. Finally, he makes a shocking accusation: that
Yeltsin’s own inner circle was involved in planning his assassination.
The entire speech is a passionate, accusatory indictment of the Yeltsin
era.

This text is a firsthand account by Vladimir Bondarenko describing a
massive, spontaneous anti-Yeltsin demonstration on Dvorцова Square in
St. Petersburg in March 1997. The demonstration, fueled by widespread
discontent with the government, economic hardship, and rising prices,
drew a crowd of over 30,000 people. Bondarenko highlights the city’s
transformation into a hotbed of resistance, noting its industrial and
population significance and the stark contrast with the wealthier, more
prosperous Moscow.

The account details the chaotic and passionate nature of the protest,
featuring a diverse group of participants including disgruntled workers,
students, nationalists, and even figures like Slava Marichev. The
governor, Yakovlev, was largely ignored and ridiculed by the crowd.
Bondarenko emphasizes the city’s transformation into a site of
resistance, comparing the situation to the Albanian situation and
suggesting a need to “learn from the Albanians” – to prepare for a fight
against Yeltsin. The article concludes with a celebratory assessment of
the demonstration as a successful “first lesson” in Russian resistance,

<p>

This text outlines the complex and evolving relationship between Russia
and Belarus, focusing on the ongoing attempts to forge a union despite
significant obstacles and competing viewpoints. It details three primary
projects: one centered around formal institutionalization and
technological integration, another actively opposing Belarusian
President Lukashenko, and a third supporting Lukashenko’s vision.

The discussion highlights the significant media manipulation surrounding
the issue, with mainstream Russian outlets deliberately marginalizing
the project. Key figures, including Alexander Prokhanov and Oleg
Rumyantsev, analyze the historical stages of the Belarus-Russia project,
noting its initial optimism, subsequent setbacks due to political
maneuvering, and the eventual “blef” or bluff surrounding the project.

The text emphasizes the importance of a genuine, grassroots support for
the union, recognizing that the project’s success hinges on a shared
vision and a willingness to overcome political divisions. It suggests
that the current media landscape actively works against this, fueling a
counter-narrative aimed at undermining Lukashenko and the broader union
effort. Ultimately, the text argues that despite the challenges, the
underlying desire for a closer relationship between the two nations
remains strong and that a successful union is achievable if the right
conditions – primarily a shift in the media narrative and a commitment
to genuine collaboration – are met.

This text recounts the history of the “Centranuchfilm” studio,
established in the 1940s in Khimki-Khovrino, Moscow, during the post-war
period. Initially a highly successful and innovative studio producing
scientific, educational, and military films, it was instrumental in
training soldiers and disseminating scientific knowledge. Key figures
like Georgiy Mel’nik, Marshal Zhukov, and Bulgakov played crucial roles
in its development and funding. The studio’s output was remarkable,
producing over 100 films annually and pioneering techniques like
combined, animation, and space-related filmmaking. However, following
the decline of Soviet ideology and the associated funding, the studio
drastically reduced its output and fell into disrepair, with most of its
skilled staff facing poverty and unemployment. The text paints a
poignant picture of a once-great institution now reduced to a shadow of
its former self, highlighting the tragic fate of its dedicated
filmmakers and the broader consequences of ideological shifts and

<p>
The text is a collection of short, fragmented scenes and vignettes,
primarily set in a bleak, rural landscape reminiscent of ancient Russia.
It explores themes of loss, isolation, poverty, and the enduring
presence of the past. Recurring motifs include a woman in black robes
(“черная парча”), a sense of decay and ruin, and a yearning for
connection and salvation. The scenes shift between a wealthy Parisian
society and a desolate, almost mythical, rural setting. Characters
appear in states of distress and vulnerability, often unable to help

The text expresses skepticism about the planned renaming of a square in
St. Petersburg to “Square of Academic Sakharov.” It highlights that
Sakharov’s fame was largely built outside of Leningrad, contrasting his
achievements with those of scientists like Mendeleev and Lomonosov who
were associated with the area. The author criticizes the initiative,
particularly given the financial difficulties faced by the Academy of
Sciences, and suggests the idea of a statue depicting Sakharov as a

SPETSNAZ AKBAR!

<p>
1997-05-05 - <b> Boris Karpov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a fragmented, reflective account of a military journalist’s
experiences in Chechnya during the late 1990s, primarily focusing on the
rise of radical Islamic separatism and the complex, often contradictory,
attitudes of the Chechen people. It’s a series of observations and
recollections, colored by disillusionment and a sense of historical
irony.

The core theme revolves around the escalating use of “Allahu Akbar” as a
rallying cry by Chechen fighters, initially a desperate attempt to gain
sympathy and support, but quickly becoming a symbol of extremism and
defiance. The author notes the increasing intensity of this cry,
reflecting the growing desperation and violence of the conflict. He
observes the psychological impact on the soldiers, their attempts to
respond with “Jesus is Risen!” or “Special Forces, Allah Akbar!” and the
resulting outrage among the local population.

The text explores the breakdown of trust and the shifting loyalties of
the Chechen people. The author recounts conversations with civilians,
including a woman who initially accused Russian soldiers of being
“hostages” and later invoked historical grievances, and the nostalgic
longing for a “Soviet-like” life, even as the fighters embraced radical
Islam. He describes the psychological manipulation employed by the
Chechen leadership, using historical narratives and religious rhetoric
to fuel the conflict.

The author highlights the dangers of religious extremism, noting the
imposition of strict Islamic laws, including the threat of death for
apostates, and the manipulation of religious symbols for political gain.
He reflects on the legacy of Imam Shamil and the irony of the Chechen
fighters quoting him while simultaneously rejecting the allegiance to
Russia.

Ultimately, the text is a sobering account of a conflict fueled by
religious fervor, historical grievances, and the breakdown of social
order, leaving the reader with a sense of unease and a reflection on the
complexities of identity, loyalty, and the enduring power of propaganda.

The text argues against proposals to redesign Moscow’s Red Square,

opposition to the Mausoleum is driven by political motives, not
historical concerns. He argues that the Mausoleum, designed by
architects Shusev and Kazakov, has fundamentally altered the square,

construction, with its high-quality materials and unique design, has
established it as a globally significant architectural landmark. The

This text is a reminiscence by Olga Genkina about Eduard Sagalaev, a
prominent television figure from the 1990s. It details Sagalaev’s rise
and fall, beginning with his success in the youth editorial roles at ЦТ
(All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company) and his
subsequent work on “Vzglyad” (The View) program. The narrative charts
his ambition, his attempts to establish his own television company
(TV-6), and his eventual decline marked by excessive indulgence, a shift
in lifestyle, and a public scandal.

The piece highlights Sagalaev’s initial brilliance and innovative ideas,
particularly the “Vzglyad” and “Vstrechi v Ostan kino” (Meetings in
Ostankino) formats, which were later revived. However, it emphasizes his
self-destruction through overindulgence, a loss of focus, and
ultimately, a failure to maintain his earlier success. The text

Alexander Lukashenko: FROM BREST TO VLADIVOSTOK
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-05-12 - <b> Aleksandr Lukashenko </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a transcript of a lengthy interview with Belarusian
President Alexander Lukashenko, conducted in Minsk shortly before a
crucial discussion regarding the Russia-Belarus Union. The core of the
interview centers on Lukashenko’s vision for this union, framed as a
battle between forces aligned with “good” and “evil,” prioritizing
Slavic unity and rejecting Western influence.

Lukashenko argues that the union’s strength lies in its pragmatic
approach, rejecting overly ambitious goals and focusing on tangible
benefits like economic integration and access to Western markets. He
expresses skepticism about Western intentions, viewing them as driven by
a desire to isolate and weaken Russia and Belarus. He emphasizes the
importance of a strong, independent Belarus, rejecting any attempts to
impose a “one-size-fits-all” model.

Crucially, Lukashenko attributes his strength to a deep-seated sense of
responsibility and a desire to serve his people, fueled by the support
he receives from the Belarusian population. He dismisses personal
ambition, stating his primary goal is to contribute positively to the
union’s success. He also expresses concern about potential manipulation
by Western actors, particularly regarding the union’s future and the
possibility of a compromised “alternative” agreement. Ultimately, he
frames his actions as driven by a commitment to preserving Belarus’s
sovereignty and fostering a strong, independent Slavic alliance.

This text, dated May 20, 1997, analyzes the complex and precarious
situation surrounding the conflict between Moldova and the Transnistria
region. It details the key events leading up to the signing of the
Moscow Memorandum, a document intended to normalize relations between
the two sides. The author highlights the significant external
involvement, primarily from Russia, Ukraine, and the OSCE, and the role
of powerful actors like NATO and the European Union.

The core issue is the unresolved conflict stemming from Moldova’s
initial aspirations for unification with Romania and the subsequent
emergence of Transnistria as a separatist entity. The text argues that
the situation is characterized by a “precedent” – the creation of an
independent Transnistria – which has created a volatile and
unpredictable geopolitical landscape.

Several key factors contribute to this instability: the reluctance of
all parties to definitively resolve the conflict, the diverse and often
conflicting interests of external actors (Russia, Ukraine, the OSCE, and
NATO), and the inherent difficulties in reconciling competing claims
regarding sovereignty, territorial integrity, and self-determination.
The author emphasizes that the situation is not simply a regional
conflict but a microcosm of broader geopolitical tensions and the
challenges of managing post-Soviet transitions. The document concludes
with a pessimistic assessment of Russia’s attempts to leverage this
situation for geopolitical gain, suggesting that it will likely
exacerbate tensions and create further instability.

<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the 1997 Russian-Chechen peace
agreement and the figures involved, primarily Boris Березовский and
Udugov, along with broader geopolitical analyses surrounding the
conflict. The author argues that the agreement is a carefully
constructed illusion, built on lies and designed to serve external
interests, particularly those of Western powers and figures like Boris
Abramovich, who are portrayed as manipulating events for personal gain.

The core argument is that the “peace” is a smokescreen, masking a deeper
game involving the manipulation of religious and geopolitical forces –
specifically, the framing of Islam as a “Great Satan” to justify Western
intervention. The author contends that figures like Березовский and
Udugov are not genuinely concerned with the welfare of Chechens but are
instead pawns in a larger scheme to exploit the situation for strategic
advantage.

The text highlights the dangers of accepting simplistic narratives and
the importance of critical thinking. It suggests that Russia’s role
should not be to “hold a shield between hostile races” but to protect
its own territory and interests, recognizing the potential for
manipulation and external influence. The author ultimately concludes
that the situation is far more complex and dangerous than it appears,
and that Russia must maintain a clear-eyed perspective to avoid becoming
a victim of geopolitical machinations. The piece is filled with cynical
observations about the motivations of key players and a deep distrust of
Western intentions.

This text recounts a journalist’s experience visiting Palestine,
specifically focusing on his visit to Jerusalem and the sites associated
with the life and death of Jesus Christ. The journey begins with a
frustrating and intrusive border crossing experience in Jordan,
highlighting the difficulties and security measures encountered when
entering Palestine and Israel.

The core of the narrative details a deeply personal and somewhat cynical
exploration of the Holy Land. The author describes a series of
encounters with Palestinian officials and residents, portraying a scene
of constant surveillance, questioning, and a general sense of being
treated as a suspect. He details the intrusive border checks, the
lengthy searches of his belongings, and the feeling of being constantly
scrutinized.

The text then focuses on the religious sites in Jerusalem, particularly
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where the author describes the
overwhelming crowds and the intense atmosphere of devotion. He details
his visit to the Grotto of Gethsemane, the location of Jesus’s last
supper and arrest, and the tomb of Christ, emphasizing the profound
sense of history and spirituality associated with these locations.

Throughout the journey, the author expresses a mixture of awe and
frustration, reflecting on the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and the challenges of experiencing the Holy Land as a visitor.
He notes the stark contrast between the religious significance of the
sites and the ongoing political tensions. The text concludes with a
reflection on the experience, acknowledging the profound impact of
visiting these sacred places while also recognizing the difficulties and
limitations of observing them from an outsider’s perspective.

decline and isolating him from key decision-makers. The author suggests
that Chubais and Patrusov were actively involved in a pre-planned
scenario to consolidate power, utilizing a staged “Council of Defense”
to swiftly remove Rodionov and potentially target other figures like the
Minister of Internal Affairs, Anatoly Kulikov. The text portrays Yeltsin

The text is a lengthy statement, a “Call to Action,” issued by the
Fourth World Russian People’s Council in May 1997, expressing deep
concern about the deteriorating health and spiritual well-being of the
Russian population. It identifies a crisis characterized by declining
birth rates, rising mortality (particularly from accidents, addictions,

The Council attributes these problems to factors including economic
hardship, reduced healthcare funding, the influence of destructive

lack of national unity.

It proposes a series of urgent measures, including prioritizing
healthcare funding (at least 5% of GDP), developing a national health

moral corruption, strengthening the role of the Russian Orthodox Church,
and promoting traditional Russian culture and values. The Council

This text is a highly cynical and fragmented analysis of the political
situation in Russia during the summer and autumn of 1997. It’s a series
of observations and predictions from several participants regarding the
instability of the Yeltsin administration and the maneuvering of various
political factions.

The core argument is that the current political landscape is nearing its
breaking point, characterized by a complete exhaustion of reform efforts
and a deeply fractured political environment. Several key figures –
including Yeltsin, Chubais, Beriev, and others – are seen as playing a
role in a complex, often contradictory, game of power.

The text predicts a “forced march” or “final push” in the autumn, likely
involving a reshuffle of the government and potentially a shift in
leadership. It suggests that this push will be driven by a combination
of factors, including the waning influence of Yeltsin, the maneuvering
of regional barons, and the ongoing conflict between different political
factions (particularly those aligned with the military-industrial
complex and those associated with Western influence).

Several participants view the situation as a “puppet show” or “game”
with key players like Beriev acting as “transmission links” between
different power centers. There’s a strong sense of cynicism, with many
participants believing that the situation is driven by personal
ambitions and short-term gains rather than any genuine commitment to
reform or the well-being of the country. The text emphasizes the
importance of understanding the dynamics of this “game” to anticipate
future developments. It concludes with a call for reflection and
observation before the “final push” occurs.

HUNTING THE WOLVES
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-08-04 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a lengthy, nostalgic defense of Viktor Volkov, a former
head of the Chernsky District Administration in the Tula region of
Russia. It’s a scathing critique of “Izvestia,” a long-standing,
now-defunct liberal newspaper, and its persistent campaign to discredit
Volkov. Volkov is portrayed as a genuinely patriotic and effective
administrator who prioritized the needs of his rural community and
resisted the pressures of Moscow-based liberal influence, particularly
from “Izvestia.” The author recounts numerous instances of “Izvestia’s”
harassment, including fabricated accusations of corruption, manipulation
of funds, and obstruction of national security efforts during the
Chechen conflict. These accusations are presented as absurd and driven
by a desire to undermine Volkov’s success. The text highlights Volkov’s
resilience, unwavering commitment to his community, and his ability to
effectively counter the smear campaigns of “Izvestia.” It emphasizes his
practical achievements – building homes, supporting local businesses,
and safeguarding the region from external threats – and portrays him as
a victim of ideological bias and relentless negativity. The author
expresses admiration for Volkov’s character and views him as a
representative of authentic Russian values, contrasting him with the
perceived arrogance and manipulative tendencies of the liberal elite.

1997-08-04 - <b> Vladislav Shurygin </b>
</p>
<p>
The text discusses the persistent rumors of the survival of Chechen
President Akhmat Kadyrov (Dzhokhar Dudayev) and the widespread belief in
his resurrection within Chechnya. Despite multiple reports of his death,
fueled by figures like Shamil Basayev and Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, and
supported by financial backing and organizational efforts, the rumors
continue. These rumors are strategically beneficial to various parties,
including Moscow, which uses them to maintain influence over
Shmaghadyrov, and to various factions within Chechnya. The author
questions who benefits from the continued belief in Dudayev’s survival
and expresses concern that if Dudayev were to reappear, he would be
portrayed similarly to religious figures like Jesus, Muhammad, and
Buddha by pro-government media.

<h3>
Debunking the myth
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-08-04 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text details the publication of Gennady Zyuganov’s autobiography,
“My Russia,” in the United States in 1997, shortly after the Russian
presidential elections. The book’s release is viewed as a strategic move
by the publisher, “M.E. Sharpe,” capitalizing on a perceived
informational vacuum in the American public’s understanding of Russian
politics and the left-patriotic opposition.

The core argument is that the book’s publication serves to challenge the
dominant Western narrative surrounding Russia – specifically, the myth
of a successful, irreversible transition to a liberal, Western-aligned
model, and the perceived strength of the Yeltsin regime. It aims to
provide a counter-narrative, exposing the ongoing challenges faced by
the Communist Party of Russia and highlighting the continued relevance
of left-patriotic forces.

The author, Boris Zanegin, believes the book will penetrate the
anti-communist biases ingrained in American consciousness and offer a
more accurate portrayal of Russia’s political landscape. He sees the
publication as a step towards fostering understanding between the US and
a future socialist Russia.

The text also notes the strategic timing of the release, coinciding with
the election results, and the publisher’s intention to make the book
accessible through a mass-market edition. It highlights the potential
for the book to influence academic and analytical circles, and expresses
optimism about its contribution to improved relations between the two
countries. Finally, the text acknowledges the complexities within the
Russian left, particularly the divisions within the Communist Party, and
suggests that the book’s impact will depend on its ability to reach a
broad audience and challenge established assumptions.

Insider Trading - Chubais
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-08-04 - <b> Nikolay Mikhaylov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the economic and social situation in
Norilsk, Russia, primarily focusing on the Norilsk Nickel mining and
metallurgical complex and the role of figures like Vladimir Chuprunov
and Vladimir Potanin. It details a history of mismanagement, corruption,
and exploitation stemming from a series of flawed economic reforms and
privatization efforts initiated in the 1990s.

The core argument is that despite significant mineral wealth and
productive capacity, Norilsk’s economy was systematically dismantled
through a combination of state-controlled privatization under Vladimir
Chuprunov’s “Norilsk Nickel” (a structure designed to concentrate power
and wealth) and subsequent asset stripping by entities like Omskbank
(ONEXIM Bank) and its associated financial networks. This resulted in
massive financial losses for the company, widespread debt, and the
decline of the city’s industrial base and social infrastructure.

The text highlights a pattern of control and manipulation, where revenue
from the sale of nickel, copper, and other metals was not reinvested in
the company or the region, but instead used to pay off debts, fund the
personal enrichment of key figures, and ultimately, to maintain a system
of control. The author emphasizes the lack of accountability and the
failure of regulatory bodies to intervene effectively.

A key element of the critique is the “Norilsk Nickel” structure itself,
designed to consolidate power and prevent independent oversight. The
text also points to the exploitation of “Norilskgazprom,” the gas
supplier to the complex, with significant debts going unpaid. The author
concludes with a sense of impending disaster, suggesting that without
fundamental changes – including external management and a halt to the
flawed privatization model – Norilsk faces economic collapse.

</p>
<p>
The text details the initiative of the “Fund for the Unity of Orthodox
Peoples” to construct a chapel dedicated to the Holy Princes Boris and
Gleb on Moscow’s Arbatskaya Square. This chapel is intended to replace
the original church, which was demolished in 1930 after being deemed a
hindrance to traffic and part of a city planning scheme. The church’s
destruction was initiated by the Hamavniki district council and the
Moscow Administration. The new chapel design incorporates a side chapel
dedicated to St. Theron (later renamed St. Mary Magdalene), mirroring
the fate of the previously demolished St. Theron’s Church. The project,
championed by architect Yuri Vylegzhanin, aims to serve as a visible
symbol of reconciliation and unity, particularly given the Princes Boris
and Gleb were the first Russian Orthodox saints canonized after
suffering during a period of internal conflict. The initiative has
gained support from prominent figures including Patriarch Alexy II and
various government bodies, with the hope of broader public involvement
as a tangible representation of repentance and unity within the Russian
Orthodox Church.

GUARANTOR BANKRUPTCY
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-08-11 - <b> Vladimir Vinnikov </b>
</p>
<p>
The article, written by Vladimir Vinnikov, critiques the actions of
President Yeltsin and his administration, particularly the recent
currency redenomination. It argues that Russia’s economic situation –
characterized by massive debt, declining production, and dependence on
the IMF – is a direct result of Yeltsin’s policies, including
privatization, the sale of Eastern European assets, and the dismantling
of the Soviet Union. The redenomination is viewed as a deceptive tactic
to conceal the country’s financial woes and potentially increase the
money supply, effectively delaying bankruptcy. The author uses the
analogy of a bankrupt gambler (“garant”) to illustrate Yeltsin’s
situation and questions who will guarantee the dubious “reforms” he
championed. The article suggests that the redenomination is a desperate
attempt to avoid acknowledging the severity of Russia’s economic
problems and raises concerns about the future stability of the
situation.

DANCES ON BLOOD
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-08-11 - <b> Vladislav Shurygin </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a cynical commentary on recent funeral rituals for murdered
police officers in Moscow, framing them as staged displays of “victory”
for organized crime over law and morality. The author criticizes the
lack of genuine investigation into high-profile murders (like those of
Talakov, Liseev, and Kvelidzi) and suggests that the current police
force and judicial system are deeply corrupted and complicit with
criminal groups. The author argues that these elaborate funerals,
attended by prominent figures, are a cover for the impunity enjoyed by
criminals, fueled by bribery, corruption, and a breakdown of
accountability within the law enforcement and judicial systems. The
piece expresses a bleak view of Russia’s state of law and order,
portraying the funerals as celebrations of criminal success rather than
genuine mourning and justice.

1997-08-11 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the state of
inter-ethnic relations in Russia following the 1993 Constitution.
Vladimir Zhironovsky argues that the constitution, combined with
post-Soviet events like the Chechen wars and the suppression of national
movements (exemplified by the prosecution of K.S. Smirnov-Ostašvili),
exacerbated existing tensions. He advocates for a radical restructuring
of the federation, including the abolition of national republics and the
introduction of privileges for representatives of indigenous
populations, alongside a strong emphasis on protecting Russian national
identity and combating “anti-patriotic propaganda.” He believes the key
issue is a fundamental shift away from the “trading civilization” of the
West and a return to traditional values, particularly Orthodox
Christianity.

Ruslan Hasbulatov offers a more pessimistic assessment, attributing the
deterioration of inter-ethnic relations to Russia’s adoption of
Western-influenced values and the rise of a “trading civilization.” He
believes the situation is worsened by the influence of the legal system,
which he sees as promoting a secular, “humanistic” worldview at the
expense of religious faith. He calls for a return to religious
principles, specifically Islam, and advocates for a legal system that
prioritizes religious freedom and the preservation of traditional
values, rejecting the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church. He
criticizes the new Law on Freedom of Conscience and suggests that the
legal system is fundamentally flawed. Finally, Rashidshah, a
representative of the Union of Muslims of Russia, echoes Hasbulatov’s
sentiment, emphasizing the importance of adhering to Islamic principles
and rejecting the influence of Western values and the Russian Orthodox
Church.

This text is a highly fragmented and speculative collection of
intelligence reports and rumors circulating in the late 1990s, primarily
concerning the political and economic turmoil in Russia during the
Yeltsin era. It details a complex web of plots, assassinations, and
manipulations involving figures like Boris Nemtsov, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
and Anatoly Chubays.

Key themes include: a planned assassination of Vice-Governor Manevicha
orchestrated by Moscow figures for political reasons, not privatization;
a complex scheme involving Soros, Saudi financiers, and Chechen warlords
to “redirect” President Maschado away from Boris Yeltsin; attempts to
destabilize Yeltsin through various means, including a damaging video
campaign orchestrated by “the Nizhny Novgorod group”; and a series of
geopolitical maneuvers aimed at isolating Russia and creating
opportunities for financial gain, particularly through the redirection
of Ukrainian gas and oil routes.

The reports are filled with unsubstantiated claims, speculation, and
shifting alliances, suggesting a climate of paranoia and intense power
struggles. They also highlight the involvement of intelligence services
and the use of disinformation to influence events.

The text is a collection of short, evocative pieces exploring themes of

“СВЯТАЯ РУСЬ НА НЕБЕСАХ” (Holy Russia in the Heavens), a poem about a
fallen people connected to the stars and light, alongside “КОСЫНКА”
(Kosynka – a blue kerchief), which uses the image of the kerchief as a
symbol of Russian womanhood and loss. “РУБАШКА” (Shirt) describes a
miraculous shirt created by the earth, and “СВЕЧА В ЗАБРОШЕННОЙ ЧАСОВНЕ”
(Candle in a Abandoned Chapel) depicts a moment of religious awe and
warning. Other pieces, like “КУВШИН” (Kușin – sitting), “СЛЕД ЧЕЛОВЕКА”
(Trace of a Man), “РУЧЕЙ” (Stream), and “ОБЛАКА” (Clouds), further
develop these themes through imagery of nature, memory, and the uncanny.
The overall effect is a fragmented, dreamlike exploration of Russia’s

This text is a satirical recounting of a hypothetical meeting between

observations of Boris Yeltsin and his inner circle. The core of the
piece is a darkly humorous comparison of the two groups – the pragmatic,

revealing, highlighting Yeltsin’s alcoholism, incompetence, and bizarre
decision-making processes, culminating in absurd proposals like using
lasers to blind Congressmen. The text emphasizes the contrast between
the two groups’ approaches, portraying the US team as rational and

</p>
<p>

This text is a lengthy interview with retired General Dmitry Yakovlevich
Zhovich, reflecting on the evolution of the Soviet and Russian armed
forces and criticizing contemporary leadership. Yakovlevich expresses
deep concern about the current state of the military, attributing it to
a lack of strategic thinking, a reliance on political maneuvering, and a
disregard for the historical experience of the armed forces. He
highlights a key theme: the disconnect between political leadership and
the practical realities of military management.

He details his experiences during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Afghan
War, and the reforms under Gorbachev and Yeltsin, emphasizing the
importance of thorough planning, clear objectives, and a deep
understanding of military capabilities. He criticizes the current
leadership’s tendency to prioritize short-term political gains over
long-term strategic considerations, pointing to the chaotic and poorly
coordinated events surrounding the Chechen conflict as a prime example.

Yakovlevich expresses a profound skepticism about the current political
climate, believing that the military is being used as a tool for
political expediency rather than a force for national security. He
laments the lack of respect for military expertise and the tendency to
surround the President with sycophants rather than experienced officers.
He concludes with a pessimistic assessment of the future of the Russian
armed forces, arguing that without a fundamental shift in leadership and
a renewed commitment to strategic thinking, the military will continue
to be a source of instability and weakness.

editor, a former ideological figure, has become consumed by a bizarre
obsession with her son’s fate and the broader criminal landscape of
Russia. She’s spiraling into delusion, crafting increasingly absurd

1997-09-22 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

The article, “Blast at the End of the Tunnel,” by Igor Feofanov,
explores the vulnerability of Moscow’s metro system to terrorist
attacks. It argues that the metro is an exceptionally attractive target
due to its high passenger density, enclosed spaces, and the potential
for devastating consequences – death from shrapnel, burial by collapsing
ceilings, fires, and panic-induced casualties.

The author contends that despite security measures like document checks
and metal detector sweeps, these efforts are often insufficient and
ineffective, particularly against sophisticated or improvised explosive
devices. He criticizes the reliance on a “Russian ‘avos’”—a sense of
fatalism and assumption that everything will be alright—and questions
the effectiveness of law enforcement, citing the unsolved murders of
Litvinenko and Kholodov as evidence of systemic failures.

Furthermore, the article highlights the diverse range of potential
attackers, from Chechen militants to Ukrainian nationalists and
extremist groups, suggesting that complete control or negotiation is
impossible. The author concludes that despite the inherent risks,
millions of Muscovites continue to use the metro daily, driven by a
pragmatic acceptance of the danger and a lack of viable alternatives.

<p>
1997-09-29 - <b> Vladimir Bondarenko </b>
</p>
<p>

This text reflects on the enduring mythos surrounding the October 1993
events in Russia, specifically the defense of the White House. It argues
that the events, despite being a largely unsuccessful defense against a
democratically elected government, have become a powerful and enduring
symbol of resistance, heroism, and the defense of individual liberty.

The author contends that the key figures involved – a diverse group of
intellectuals, writers, and activists – were motivated by a genuine
desire for freedom and a rejection of authoritarianism, rather than a
specific political agenda. They represent a “heroic po\[r\]ush,” a
beautiful, almost mythical, impulse to resist oppression.

Despite the defeat, the text emphasizes the lasting impact of this
“heroic po\[r\]ush” on Russian culture and identity. It highlights how
the events have been continually romanticized and celebrated through
art, literature, and memory, solidifying the figures involved as
enduring symbols of resistance. The author suggests that this mythos
continues to influence contemporary Russian society, providing a source
of inspiration and a reminder of the importance of defending fundamental
rights. The text ultimately portrays the October 1993 events not as a
historical failure, but as a potent and ongoing narrative of Russian
heroism and resistance.

Battle at Nigh

1997-10-13 - <b> Sergey Kurginyan </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of Western perceptions and actions
regarding Russia, particularly focusing on the influence of figures like
Robert Gates and James Woolsey. It argues that Western assessments,
fueled by a flawed understanding of Russia’s history and current
situation, have actively contributed to a climate of hostility and,
ultimately, a disastrous outcome.

Here’s a breakdown of the key arguments:

-   **Western Misinterpretations:** The author contends that Western
    figures have consistently misconstrued Russia’s motivations and
    actions, attributing them to criminal intent rather than strategic
    considerations.
-   **The “Night Battle” Metaphor:** The core concept is the “Night
    Battle,” representing a prolonged period of destructive influence
    and manipulation by Western forces. This battle is fueled by a
    failure to understand Russia’s perspective and a deliberate effort
    to undermine its stability.
-   **The Role of Specific Figures:** The text names specific
    individuals (Gates, Woolsey, Burg, etc.) as key architects of this
    negative influence.
-   **A Call to Action:** It urges a shift in Western thinking,
    advocating for a more nuanced and empathetic approach to Russia,
    recognizing the potential for a catastrophic outcome if the current
    trajectory continues.
-   **Critique of Western “Intervention”**: The author views Western
    actions as a deliberate attempt to destabilize Russia, framing it as
    a “night battle” against a nation perceived as inherently criminal.

In essence, the text is a polemic against Western foreign policy,
arguing that it has been driven by misjudgment, arrogance, and a desire
to impose a specific narrative on Russia.

The text is a series of fragmented reflections and observations,

decay, and the loss of ideals in Russia following the collapse of the
Soviet Union. It’s characterized by a cynical and often darkly humorous
tone, filled with vivid imagery and metaphors. The author contrasts the

of artistic and intellectual pursuits, and the struggle for survival
amidst chaos. The author reflects on personal experiences – including
involvement in the 1993 Moscow barricades – and observes the behavior of
various groups within Russian society, from artists and intellectuals to
merchants and those living on the fringes of Moscow. There’s a sense of
lament for a lost Russia, a yearning for authenticity, and a critical
assessment of the new, often cynical, order. The text is less a cohesive
narrative and more a collection of snapshots, reflecting a deeply
troubled and observant perspective.

The article critiques the atmosphere within the State Duma during a
budget discussion, portraying it as a comedy due to the Premier,
Chernomyrdin’s, inappropriate behavior and the journalists’ amusement.
It argues that this frivolous environment undermines the seriousness of
the budget debate and the country’s economic situation. The author
contrasts this with the past, where parliamentarians would confront the
government forcefully. He questions the integrity of opposition deputies
who engage in seemingly subservient behavior towards the government,
suggesting a lack of respect for voters and journalists. Ultimately, the
piece calls for deputies to demonstrate honesty and integrity in their
actions.

In 1997, news reported that Mayor Sobchak was mistakenly transferred to
Leninskoye, and Mayor Konakhin underwent heart surgery. Vladimir
Zhirinovsky glued himself to his seat in the Duma to protest against
Viktor Stroev. Former reformer Trakhin reappeared with a makeshift
solution. During a budget vote, Viktor Kobszon’s wig came loose. Moscow
Mayor Luzkhov threatened to cut off utilities and restrict federal
access. Deputies Sevastyanov and Chernomyrdin were observed embracing as
if they were married. Yeltsin negotiated with Kozyrev and Shirak in
Strasbourg. Yastrzemsky was “mocked” by Kostikova. A suitcase containing
$500,000, previously taken from the Kremlin, was returned to Evstafiev
with wheels. The “Yabloko” faction was likened to a disreputable tavern
where an intoxicated pharmacist offered advice on governing the country.

RUBLE-SKV, FIRE! (GENSHTAB GAZETY “ZAVTRA”)
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-10-20 - <b> Viktor Filatov </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a highly conspiratorial and critical analysis of Russia’s
economic situation, primarily blaming the United States and its
influence for the decline of the Russian ruble. It argues that the ruble
is being deliberately devalued through a complex network of manipulation
involving dollar payments, false currency production, and the actions of
key figures within the Russian government. The author posits that the
U.S. utilizes a “dollar-soldier” strategy, employing financial pressure
and deception to destabilize Russia. It suggests a deliberate plan,
allegedly orchestrated by figures like Rothschild and orchestrated
through organizations like the CIA, to undermine the ruble and control
Russia’s economy. The text proposes a radical solution: a public
declaration of the ruble’s value at $3 per unit, timed for 24 hours, as
a direct challenge to this alleged conspiracy. The overall tone is one
of deep distrust and accusation, portraying Russia as a victim of a
global financial war.

In 1997, at Nizhnekamenskшина Tire Plant, a complex scheme of
large-scale tire theft was uncovered. Multiple criminal groups, led by
figures like Nadezhа Savina and Любовь Карелина, systematically stole
tires by diverting them through the factory’s drainage system, railway
transport, and by manipulating shipping documents. The scheme involved
falsifying paperwork, using the factory’s sewage system to dispose of
stolen tires, and employing railway workers to transport them. Several
individuals were arrested and convicted for their roles in this
elaborate fraud, which involved stealing over three billion rubles worth
of tires.

This short story depicts a disturbing and unsettling incident within a
Soviet military academy. A first-year cadet, Viktor Petrov, is fatally
shot by another cadet, Vasily Chernnykh, during a late-night patrol. The
shooting stems from a complex chain of events: Chernnykh’s gambling
debts, a proposition offered to Petrov involving marijuana, and a
breakdown in discipline and oversight within the academy. The narrative
highlights the corruption, apathy, and lack of accountability prevalent
within the Soviet military system, where personal failings and debts
could lead to tragic consequences. The story emphasizes the dehumanizing
nature of the system, reducing individuals to mere instruments and
highlighting the disconnect between ideals of patriotism and the reality
of bureaucratic corruption and violence. The final lines reveal the
outcome – Chernnykh and Petrov are both dismissed from the academy,
illustrating the system’s indifference to individual fates.

A congress of Russian scientists and engineers held on October 17th at
the Parliamentary Center demonstrated a significantly stronger and more
critical response to reforms compared to a previous congress of creative
intellectuals. Scientists, led by figures like Anatoly Rakitov and
supported by others including Lev Abalkin and Victor Pokrovsky, voiced
strong opposition to the government and its policies, demanding the
resignation of the President and Government. This reaction stemmed from
a perceived bleak state of Russian science and industry under the
current leadership. The congress successfully challenged the
government’s course, offering alternative perspectives and a clear “no”

<p>
The text expresses frustration with the programming and direction of the
“Culture” television channel in Russia. The author argues that the
channel has become dominated by a “liberal-cosmopolitan” viewpoint,
excluding genuine Russian national culture and traditions. He criticizes
the channel’s leadership, particularly Mikhail Shvyddykh, and the
composition of its advisory board, which he deems overly influenced by
Western-leaning figures. The author proposes a solution: a daily “Hour

intellectuals, alongside a separate advisory board. He views the
channel’s current trajectory as detrimental to Russian culture and
identity, characterizing it as a “fifth column” undermining Russian
spiritual values.

This transcript is a lengthy and intense exchange between Svetlana
Goracheva and Alexander Prokhanov, primarily focusing on the state of
the National Patriotic Opposition and their approach to navigating the
current political landscape in Russia. Goracheva expresses deep
frustration and disillusionment with the direction the opposition has
taken, particularly regarding compromises and a perceived lack of
strategic vision.

She criticizes the perceived “softening” of the opposition, highlighting
a shift towards pragmatic compromises that she believes have diluted
their core values and purpose. She emphasizes the importance of
unwavering principles and a clear, forceful stance against what she sees
as corruption and the erosion of Russian national identity.

A central theme is the “White House” incident and the subsequent
personal sacrifices made by Goracheva, framing her experience as a
testament to her unwavering commitment to defending Russia. She
expresses a deep sense of loss and regret over the perceived abandonment
of core values and a growing sense of isolation within the opposition.

Goracheva stresses the need for a more combative and strategic approach,
advocating for a focus on mobilizing public opinion, exposing
corruption, and resisting what she views as the destructive influence of
Western values. She believes the opposition has lost its nerve and needs
to rediscover its strength and resolve. The conversation ends with a
shared sense of concern for the future of Russia and a determination to
continue fighting for its values, despite the challenges.

Bitter hangover
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-11-24 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This lengthy text is a cynical and critical analysis of the Russian
media’s role during the First Chechen War (1994-1996). The author, a
former military officer, argues that the Russian media actively fueled
the conflict and contributed to the disastrous outcome. He contends that
the media engaged in a deliberate “psychological war” against the
Russian army, portraying federal troops as “brutal” and promoting the
image of Chechen leaders like Dudayev as heroic figures.

The author highlights several specific examples of this manipulation,
including the media’s focus on “war crimes” committed by Russian forces,
the promotion of separatist propaganda, and the creation of a negative
image of Russian soldiers – portraying them as confused, impoverished,
and demoralized. He criticizes the media’s reliance on sensationalism
and the use of figures like Movladi Udugov, a former journalist who
became a key figure in the Chechen separatist movement, to amplify the
conflict.

The author expresses deep frustration with the media’s role, arguing
that it was not simply a reflection of the situation but an active
participant in creating and exacerbating the crisis. He suggests that
the media’s behavior was driven by a combination of factors, including a
desire for attention, a lack of critical thinking, and a willingness to
exploit the conflict for political gain. Ultimately, the author
concludes that the media’s actions contributed to the failure to resolve
the conflict and the subsequent suffering of both Russians and Chechens.

<p>
The text details the long and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a
new theater, originally named “Na Yuzhozapade,” in Moscow, spearheaded
by Belarusian actor Valery Belyokovich. The project began in the 1990s
with a small, community-built theater and evolved into a complex
endeavor involving architectural designs, negotiations with the Moscow
government, and attempts to secure funding from various sources,
including potential sponsors. Despite a promising design by architect
Alexander Vedenkin and initial approvals, funding issues and
bureaucratic delays repeatedly stalled the project. The story highlights
the challenges of securing resources for cultural initiatives and the
shifting priorities of the Russian government. Ultimately, the project
was abandoned, though the author notes a positive development –
increased cultural investment in Belarus, leading to the opening of new
theaters and plans for a Belarusian cultural center in Moscow,
potentially built on the same site as the stalled theater.

The author, Dm. Dudko, recommends rereading Vladimir Bogatyrev’s “Word
Father’s” collection of poems. He initially found the poems challenging,
perceiving Bogatyrev as a prose writer rather than a poet. However,
after experiencing the poems read aloud by Bogatyrev himself, he
recognized their profound beauty and spiritual depth. Bogatyrev’s unique
style, characterized by a deeply personal and emotive delivery,
resonated powerfully with the reader. The author believes that repeated
readings and listening to Bogatyrev’s rendition would evoke a
significant spiritual impression, potentially prompting reflection and
even repentance.

<p>
1997-12-01 - <b> Nikolay Anisin </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a satirical commentary on political maneuvering and
deception, primarily focusing on the potential for Russia to concede
territory to Moldova through the actions of figures like Duma Speaker
Gennady Seleznev. The core argument is that Seleznev is not genuinely
interested in fostering Russian-Moldovan relations, but rather is being
manipulated by Moldova’s President, Petre Luchinsky, a former Politburo
member, and other influential Duma members.

Luchinsky, seeking to bolster his own power and potentially align
Moldova with NATO, is leveraging Seleznev’s desire to appease these
figures. Seleznev, in turn, is deliberately misrepresenting the
positions of his parliamentary partners, particularly the “Socialist
Unity” faction, to create the illusion of support for ratifying a basic
treaty that would ultimately benefit Luchinsky.

The text highlights a cynical game of deception, where genuine concerns
about Russian-Moldovan relations are deliberately obscured to achieve
personal gain. The satirical tone emphasizes the absurdity of the
situation and the manipulative tactics employed by all parties involved.
The author suggests that if Seleznev’s deception is not exposed, then
the first version of the story – that he is being manipulated – is the
most likely truth.

fantasy literature, publish Slavic mythology, and support projects like
the “Museum of Slavic Cultures.” The author expresses hope for
Medvedev’s continued success and a brighter future for Russia, framing

On the role of “weak impulse”
</h3>
</a>
<p>
1997-12-01 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text, dated October 2–12–97, is a pessimistic analysis of the
global financial situation, particularly concerning the impact on
Russia. The author argues that a series of financial crises –
originating in Hong Kong, then spreading through Japan, Brazil, and
Korea – were triggered by a deliberate attempt by the United States to
destabilize the global financial system, specifically the dominance of
the US dollar.

The US, through actions involving major banks and speculative attacks,
aimed to weaken the dollar and shift global financial power towards the
emerging economic centers of Asia. This was achieved by orchestrating a
series of financial shocks, causing widespread instability and
triggering a domino effect across global markets, including Russia.

The author expresses concern that Russia, due to its relatively small
and weakly integrated financial system, is vulnerable to this “weak
impulse” and could be dragged into the crisis. He advocates for a shift
in Russia’s economic policy, focusing on supporting large domestic
corporations and strategically engaging with the emerging regional
economic blocs, rather than remaining reliant on Western financial
markets. The author views the situation as a deliberate manipulation and
a warning sign for Russia to pursue a more independent and strategically
focused economic path.

This text is a transcript of a dialogue between Alexander Prokhanov and
Egyptian Ambassador Reda Ahmed Shehata, discussing Egypt’s role in the
Middle East and its relationship with Russia. The core of the
conversation revolves around Egypt’s historical legacy – a civilization
built on agriculture and openness to diverse cultures – and how this
legacy informs its current foreign policy and its ambitions for the
future.

Shehata emphasizes Egypt’s independent foreign policy, its commitment to
social justice and economic freedom, and its significant role in the
region’s history. He highlights Egypt’s ability to “digest” different
cultures and its ongoing efforts to maintain stability in a volatile
area. He frames Egypt’s current actions, particularly its relationship
with Russia, as a continuation of this historical tradition.

Prokhanov explores the roots of contemporary conflict, attributing it to
a breakdown of traditional values and a rejection of established norms.
He stresses the importance of understanding Egypt’s historical
experience – its ability to absorb and integrate diverse influences – as
a key to navigating the challenges of the modern world. The conversation
concludes with a reflection on the enduring connection between the land
and its people, and the importance of preserving historical traditions
in the face of global instability.

Alexander Chekalin, born in the 1930s in the Lipetsk region of Russia,
was a successful Soviet partisan scout during World War II. He
distinguished himself within the “Forward” partisan detachment, known
for his intelligence gathering and participation in sabotage operations.
Despite his success, he was eventually captured and executed by the

Posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union in 1942,
Chekalin became a national icon. However, in the 1990s, doubts emerged
regarding his true identity and motivations, though the author maintains

This text, written in 1997, is a deeply reflective and somewhat
pessimistic commentary on contemporary Russia’s situation, particularly
concerning its vulnerability to manipulation and spiritual decay. The
author expresses concern about the Russian people’s inherent do-gooding
nature, which he sees as a weakness exploited by external and internal
enemies. He argues that Russia’s problems stem not from external forces
alone, but from a failure to trust and rely on the “inner strength” – a
spiritual and moral foundation – that has historically sustained the
nation.

The core of the text revolves around the idea that Russia’s salvation
lies in embracing faith and a humble, selfless approach, rejecting the
temptations of wealth, ambition, and superficial achievements. The
author criticizes the manipulation of public opinion through advertising
and the pursuit of worldly recognition, viewing them as destructive
forces. He emphasizes the importance of inner transformation and a
quiet, unassuming life, aligning oneself with God’s will.

He expresses skepticism about contemporary figures seeking prominence
and rewards, suggesting that these pursuits are ultimately empty. The
author urges a return to traditional values, a reliance on faith, and a
recognition of the spiritual forces at play, warning against being
swayed by external pressures and the allure of material success.
Ultimately, the text is a call for spiritual renewal and a rejection of
superficial values in the face of a perceived crisis.
