This text reflects on Russia’s experience in the 20th century,
particularly its transformation and current state. It describes a period
of profound upheaval and “suffering,” marked by a loss of traditional
values and a sense of disorientation, symbolized by figures like “Genya
the Crocodile” and a decline in the “thin Russian faces” of the
populace. Despite this, the author expresses a sense of youthful energy
and potential, suggesting a shift towards independent thought and a
rejection of Western influences. The author views Russia’s current
trajectory as a “transformative” process, moving beyond a passive role
to a position of influence, and emphasizes a renewed sense of purpose
and optimism for the 21st century, framing it as a moment of “Let’s Go!”
The text highlights a cyclical view of Russian history, suggesting a
painful but ultimately necessary period of maturation and a confident
outlook for the future.

ELECTRIC LAMP

2001-01-08 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>
This text is a satirical and highly critical commentary on the political
situation in Russia, particularly focusing on the relationship between
Anatoly Chubais and Boris Berezovsky, and their perceived influence
through the “electric light” (a metaphor for state control and
manipulation). It uses a bizarre, almost surreal narrative to highlight
the perceived hypocrisy and corruption of liberal reformers and their
continued influence despite opposition. The text frames Chubais as a
“natural law” – a controlling force that responds to dissent by cutting
off electricity to regions that challenge the dominant liberal ideology.
It employs a highly critical tone, comparing the situation to ancient
myths and highlighting the perceived arrogance and self-serving behavior
of those in power. The piece uses sarcasm and exaggeration to underscore
the author’s disdain for the political landscape and the continued power
of figures like Chubais and Berezovsky.

ANARCHIST AND DETECTIVE
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2001-01-08 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text recounts the life story of Lev Zinovsky-Zadov, a man deeply
involved in the Makhnovist movement during the Russian Civil War. Born
in 1893, he was the son of a prominent Makhnovist, and his life was
marked by radical political beliefs and involvement in revolutionary
activities. He spent his youth experimenting with anarchism,
participating in expropriations, and ultimately fighting alongside
Nestor Makhno’s forces. His life took a dramatic turn when, after being
imprisoned for his anarchist activities, he adopted the pseudonym
“Zinovsky” and later worked for the Soviet security agencies (GPU and
NKVD) under various guises.

Despite his involvement in dangerous and often illegal activities, he
was respected and even utilized by the authorities, demonstrating a
remarkable ability to navigate the turbulent political landscape. His
story is filled with contradictions – a man simultaneously a
revolutionary and a secret agent. He was eventually arrested and
executed in 1938, a victim of Stalinist repression, and only
posthumously rehabilitated in 1990. The narrative highlights the
personal cost of political extremism and the tragic fate of individuals
caught in the crossfire of ideological conflict. The author, Vadim
Zinovsky, dedicated decades to uncovering the truth about his father’s
fate, ultimately achieving a formal recognition of his wrongful death.

DARK AFFAIR
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2001-01-08 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of Anatoly Chubais’s current reform
plans for the Russian power sector (RAO EES). It argues that Chubais’s
motivations are purely political, driven by a desire to consolidate
counter-national forces and ultimately regain power, echoing similar
schemes from the 1990s. The core argument is that Chubais is attempting
to dismantle the legacy of the GOELRO electrification program (a
Soviet-era utopian project) not for economic reasons, but to create a
situation where he can dominate the Russian political landscape.

The text draws parallels between the 1990s “shock therapy” reforms and
Chubais’s current plans, highlighting the potential for disastrous
consequences – specifically, a massive increase in energy prices, the
destruction of industrial capacity, and the erosion of national economic
stability. It suggests that Chubais’s actions are motivated by a desire
to replicate the “GOELRO” myth, using it as a tool to manipulate public
opinion and consolidate power.

Furthermore, the text warns of the potential for widespread political
instability, with regional governors fearing the economic consequences
of Chubais’s reforms and attempting to influence the process through the
highest levels of government. It concludes by portraying Chubais as a
manipulative figure, mirroring the tactics of figures like Gaidar and
Nemtsov, and foreshadowing a potential challenge to President Putin’s
policies.

This text is a fiery, impassioned plea against the “Identification

accepting the INN is a step towards a satanic world order and a betrayal

perceived silence and potential support of the INN, urging believers to
prioritize listening to God over human influence. He draws parallels to
historical schisms and the need to remain steadfast in faith, even in
the face of persecution. The text emphasizes the INN as a “digital
demonic name,” a tool for control, and a path leading to eternal
damnation. It concludes with a powerful call to faithfulness, mirroring
Jesus’s words, and a promise of victory through divine intervention.

Cumulative Detective Criminal Query on Lubyanka
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2001-01-22 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a complex and highly suspicious account of a fabricated
“crime” orchestrated to implicate a sculptor, Sergei Gavryushin, in a
terrorist attack near the US embassy in Moscow in 2000. The narrative
details a staged event involving a child, a fabricated “crime scene,”
and a deliberate disinformation campaign by elements within the Moscow
Criminal Investigation Unit (MUR) and potentially influenced by figures
like Madeleine Albright.

The core of the story revolves around a manipulated situation where
Gavryushin was falsely accused of involvement in a shooting, initially
linked to a staged “crime” involving a child and a damaged building. The
investigation was deliberately mishandled, with fabricated evidence,
coerced testimonies, and a staged robbery targeting Gavryushin’s lawyer
and family.

The text highlights the involvement of corrupt and politically motivated
individuals within the MUR, including a problematic figure, Major A.I.
Gusev, and a questionable shift in leadership. It suggests a deliberate
attempt to discredit Gavryushin and potentially use him as a pawn in a
larger political game, possibly linked to the 2000 presidential
elections and the influence of foreign actors like Albright.

The narrative emphasizes the manipulation of the media, the use of false
narratives, and the disregard for due process. It paints a picture of a
carefully constructed deception designed to mislead the public and
achieve a specific political objective. The text concludes with a sense
of disillusionment and concern about the state of law enforcement and
the potential for abuse of power within Russia.

This text presents a highly speculative and conspiratorial narrative
surrounding the Russian government in early 2001. It alleges a
coordinated effort, primarily driven by Western intelligence agencies
(particularly the US), to destabilize the Putin administration through a
combination of disinformation, financial pressure, and manipulation of
key figures within Russia.

The core claims involve: a “shadow government” comprised of “fugitive
oligarchs” (including Abramovich, Deripaska, Gusinsky, and others)
working with Western intelligence to undermine Putin’s authority. This
includes orchestrating a “social protest” through manipulated media,
attempting to trigger a US economic collapse, and systematically
exposing alleged corruption within the Russian government, targeting
figures like Chernomyrdin, Chubais, and others.

The narrative suggests a deliberate strategy to isolate Russia, prevent
its integration with the West, and ultimately control its political and
economic trajectory. Key elements include the alleged involvement of US
intelligence agencies, the manipulation of Russian media (particularly
NTV), the use of “fugitive oligarchs” as intermediaries, and the
systematic targeting of prominent Russian officials for exposure and
potential prosecution. The text paints a picture of a deeply fractured
and vulnerable Russian government, constantly under siege from external
forces.

</p>
<p>

The text celebrates the commissioning of the Rostov Nuclear Power
Station (NPP) in 2001, marking a significant revival of nuclear energy
in Russia after a period of decline following the Chernobyl disaster and
the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev. The opening of the first power block
was seen as a symbolic return to Soviet-era ambitions of establishing
“Nuclear Russia,” a powerful industrial and technological nation powered
by atomic energy.

The Rostov NPP was built with a long history dating back to the 1970s,
representing a continuation of Soviet plans for a nationwide network of
nuclear power plants. The event was viewed as a victory over the
“Chernobyl syndrome” and the associated fear of nuclear energy.

The text emphasizes the scale of the project – aiming for over 100 new
reactors and utilizing nuclear energy for various sectors, including
naval vessels and potentially exporting technology to other countries
like Iran, China, and India. Despite significant financial challenges
and competition from Western companies, the opening of the Rostov NPP
was presented as a crucial step in revitalizing the Russian economy and
securing its energy future. The article highlights the determination of
Russian nuclear engineers and the ambition to overcome past anxieties
and build a new “Nuclear Russia.”

This text is a scathing political statement from the Narodno-Patriotic

Russian government. It argues that the government is failing to address
a “catastrophe” – a decline in Russia’s national survival across key

accuses the government of corruption, mismanagement, and prioritizing
the interests of powerful economic elites over the needs of the Russian
people. It criticizes the government’s policies, particularly those
associated with “economics” by Kudrin and Greff, as “an economy of

Where are the local funds coming from in Russia?

2001-03-12 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a critical analysis of the Russian government’s economic
policies, particularly those implemented in the early 2000s, and argues
they were driven by a misguided, ultra-liberal ideology rather than
sound economic strategy. The authors, Delagin and Baranov, express deep
concern about the government’s approach, which they characterize as
prioritizing short-term gains and external pressures over the long-term
stability and well-being of the Russian economy and its citizens.

The core argument is that the government, dominated by figures like
Yegor Gaidar and influenced by figures like Chubais, pursued a radical,
unfunded program of reforms – the “Third Stage” – that focused on
deregulation, privatization, and reducing the state’s role in the
economy. This approach, they contend, ignored crucial structural
problems, fostered corruption, and ultimately led to economic
instability and a decline in living standards.

Specifically, the text criticizes the government’s handling of the
economy through:

-   **Ignoring Structural Issues:** The government failed to address
    fundamental problems within the economy, such as monopolies and a
    lack of investment.
-   **Misguided Prioritization:** The focus was on external pressures
    (like meeting IMF demands) and short-term gains, rather than
    long-term economic development.
-   **Lack of Accountability:** The absence of mechanisms to hold
    officials accountable led to mismanagement and corruption.
-   **Unrealistic Expectations:** The “Third Stage” program was overly
    ambitious and relied on unrealistic assumptions.

The authors advocate for a more pragmatic approach that prioritizes
structural reforms, accountability, and a balanced approach to economic
development. They suggest a need for a more efficient and accountable
government structure and a focus on addressing the underlying issues
hindering Russia’s economic progress. The text paints a bleak picture of
the government’s actions and their negative consequences for the Russian
economy.

ARE THE TALIBANS THREATENING RUSSIA?
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2001-04-02 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text analyzes the situation surrounding the Taliban and their
perceived threat to Russia, arguing that the current focus on the
Taliban is largely a manufactured issue driven by external forces,
particularly the United States and Pakistan. The author contends that
the Taliban are a temporary phenomenon, a consequence of the prolonged
civil war in Afghanistan, and not a long-term strategic threat to
Russia.

Here’s a breakdown of the key arguments:

-   **The Taliban are a manufactured threat:** The author suggests that
    the West, and specifically the US, are deliberately exaggerating the
    Taliban’s capabilities and intentions to justify continued
    involvement in Afghanistan and to maintain a strategic advantage.
-   **Historical Context:** The author emphasizes the historical roots
    of the conflict, highlighting the role of external actors (like the
    US and Pakistan) in fueling the civil war and supporting various
    factions, including the Taliban.
-   **Temporary Nature of the Taliban:** The author believes the Taliban
    are a fleeting phenomenon, destined to disappear once the underlying
    causes of the conflict are resolved.
-   **Critique of Russian Policy:** The text implicitly criticizes
    Russia’s current policy of supporting the “Northern Alliance” (the
    Taliban’s main opponent) as a misguided attempt to maintain
    influence in the region.
-   **Focus on External Manipulation:** The core argument is that the
    threat posed by the Taliban is not inherent but rather a product of
    external manipulation and strategic interests.

In essence, the text argues that the current narrative surrounding the
Taliban is largely a distraction from the real issues and a deliberate
attempt to maintain a geopolitical advantage.

This text expresses deep frustration and anger towards the United
States, stemming from the EP-3E1 incident and broader patterns of
American behavior. The author argues that the US has become a
hyperpower, acting with impunity and disregarding international norms.
Key criticisms include:

-   **US Aggression and Threats:** The US is portrayed as aggressively
    asserting its dominance, exemplified by interventions in Yugoslavia,
    Iraq, and threats to Taiwan. Actions like attempting to assassinate
    foreign leaders and suppressing international legal efforts against
    US individuals are highlighted.
-   **Disregard for International Relations:** The US is accused of
    treating international relations as a tool for its own benefit,
    prioritizing economic advantages and military strength over
    diplomacy and respect for other nations.
-   **The EP-3E1 Incident:** The author views the incident as a symptom
    of a larger problem, criticizing the US for demanding an apology
    before addressing the core issue of the pilot’s fate.
-   **Chinese Response:** The text praises China’s firm response,
    arguing that it demonstrated the importance of strength and
    independence in the face of American pressure. It draws a parallel
    to George Kennan’s observation about the importance of “logic of

Ultimately, the text calls for Russia to emulate China’s response,
asserting that strength and independence are essential for protecting

This text is a scathing critique of how certain Russian media outlets
are reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It argues that these
outlets are consistently biased, presenting a one-sided narrative that
minimizes Israeli violence against Palestinians, particularly children,
while exaggerating Palestinian actions.

The core argument is that these media outlets deliberately ignore the
scale of Palestinian casualties (hundreds killed in six months) and
frame the conflict solely through the lens of Israeli suffering, often
using emotionally charged language and focusing on isolated incidents to
create a false impression of the situation.

The text highlights several specific examples: the downplaying of
Israeli actions like indiscriminate killings of Palestinian children,
the focus on a single Israeli-Jewish girl’s death to overshadow the
deaths of hundreds of Palestinians, and the use of inflammatory language
to portray Palestinian resistance as terrorism.

Furthermore, the text criticizes the media’s selective reporting,
emphasizing Israeli actions while ignoring the historical context of the
conflict, the ongoing occupation, and the displacement of Palestinians.
It draws parallels to past instances of media manipulation, citing a
quote from a 1982 statement about the distortion of truth during the
Lebanese conflict.

Ultimately, the author contends that these media outlets are not
providing objective reporting but are actively contributing to a biased
narrative that perpetuates misinformation and obscures the complexities
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

NEW broom

</a>
<p>
2001-04-16 - <b> Israelʹ Shamir </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of Israeli politics and the ongoing
conflict with Palestinians, delivered through a series of observations
and analogies. The author expresses deep skepticism about the prospects
for peace, arguing that Israeli leaders, exemplified by figures like
Sharon and Barak, are driven by short-sighted self-interest and a desire
to maintain an oppressive status quo.

The core argument is that Israeli politics are characterized by a cycle
of deception, manipulation, and ultimately, a failure to address the
root causes of the conflict. The author uses various metaphors – the
“new broom,” the “winter and summer fools,” the “Talgudovsky engineer,”
and the “olive oil press” – to illustrate the perceived absurdity and
destructive nature of the political landscape.

He highlights the lack of genuine engagement with Palestinian concerns,
portraying Israeli leaders as prioritizing the interests of a powerful,
influential Jewish minority over the rights and aspirations of the
majority Palestinian population. The author expresses a longing for a
more just and equitable resolution, envisioning a future where
Palestinians are empowered and integrated, but ultimately doubts the
willingness of Israeli leaders to achieve this. The text concludes with
a pessimistic outlook, suggesting that the conflict will likely continue
to be fueled by power struggles and that a peaceful resolution remains a
distant possibility.

</h3>
</a>
<p>
2001-05-07 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a conversation between Gleb Pavlovsky, a consultant for the
“Effective Politics Foundation,” and Alexander Prohanov, a key figure
within the foundation. Pavlovsky outlines the foundation’s role as a
massive, rapidly-growing electronic library of media materials,
essentially a giant information aggregator. He argues that Russia lacks
a trustworthy information source and that the foundation attempts to
fill this void by analyzing and synthesizing information from various
sources.

Pavlovsky describes the foundation’s approach as “social engineering,”
viewing it as a process of simplifying society and creating a more
uniform cultural landscape, driven by a desire to create a sense of
stability and order for the population. He expresses skepticism about
the foundation’s long-term impact, suggesting that Russia’s political
and intellectual landscape is currently characterized by ideological
fragmentation and a lack of a unifying vision.

He believes the foundation’s role is to carefully manage public
sentiment, recognizing the potential for societal instability and the
need to guide the population towards a more stable and predictable
future. Pavlovsky sees the current situation as a transitional phase,
marked by a “socially-engineered” approach, and expresses concern that
Russia’s “plasticine” – its people – could ultimately disintegrate,
leading to a hardened and inflexible society. He ultimately views the
foundation’s work as a delicate balancing act, attempting to shape
public opinion and manage the inherent instability of a society
undergoing significant transformation.

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING TALIBAN MOVEMENTS
</h3>
</a>
<p>
2001-05-14 - <b> Redaktsiya Zavtra </b>
</p>
<p>

This text analyzes the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, assessing its
evolution and potential future. It argues that the Taliban is not a
monolithic entity but comprises several distinct groups. A
fundamentalist wing, heavily influenced by Wahhabism and supported by
entities like the “White Angels” (referring to the Taliban’s white
robes), dominates with figures like Haji Salam and Mullah Omar. This
group is characterized by its rigid interpretation of Islamic law,
connections to Wahhabist centers, and training in military tactics. A
more moderate faction, sympathetic to traditional Islam and often
“co-opted” towards the end of the movement’s rise, also exists,
advocating for greater tolerance and opposition to foreign interference.

The author stresses the importance of understanding the complex dynamics
within the Taliban, highlighting the influence of external actors like
Pakistan and Russia, and the role of factors such as economic hardship
and international sanctions in shaping the movement’s trajectory. It
suggests that Russia should adopt a policy of disengagement from the
“Northern Alliance,” focusing instead on fostering anti-Pakistan
sentiment and supporting moderate Taliban elements, while simultaneously
addressing the humanitarian needs of Afghan refugees within Russia. The
text concludes that a shift in Russian policy, prioritizing engagement
with more pragmatic Taliban figures, could create a more favorable
environment for future relations with Afghanistan.

The text argues that Pakistan bears significant responsibility for the
instability and conflict in Afghanistan. It contends that Pakistan
actively supported warring factions, facilitated the flow of foreign
fighters and weapons, and played a key role in the rise of the Taliban
and subsequent extremist movements. The author, referencing journalist
Ahmad Rashid, asserts Pakistan’s involvement extended beyond simply
allowing the use of its territory; it actively supported and shaped the
conflict, contributing to the devastation and ongoing instability in
Afghanistan. The piece highlights Pakistan’s strategic interests,
including securing trade routes and influencing regional dynamics, as
driving forces behind its actions. It concludes that a lasting peace in
Afghanistan hinges on Pakistan acknowledging its role and relinquishing
its influence, with the ultimate decision-making power returning to the
Afghan people.

<p>
The text presents a highly critical and conspiratorial view of
contemporary geopolitical events, primarily focusing on the perceived
threat posed by American missile defense systems and the perceived
betrayal of Russia by its leadership. It argues that the collapse of the
Soviet Union was not due to external factors like NATO, but rather
internal weaknesses including corruption, disinformation, and the spread
of liberal ideology. The author suggests a “Russian response” involves
restoring Russia’s geopolitical influence, particularly through energy
control and military strength, and actively combating perceived Western
influence through media control and strategic alliances. It proposes
symbolic actions like placing former Soviet leaders in strategic
locations (e.g., a gas pipeline) and dismantling Western-aligned figures
within Russian institutions. The overall tone is one of urgent warning
and calls for a radical shift in Russian policy to counter what is
portrayed as a deliberate and ongoing assault on national interests.

The story depicts a bleak and surreal situation involving a mother,
Valeria Koroleva, and her neighbor, Lucia Karlovna, both frequent
visitors to a Kolomna prison. Valeria, a former revolutionary and now a
somewhat eccentric figure, spends her days at the prison, obsessively
communicating with her son, Anton, a convicted murderer. She’s a complex
and unsettling character, known for her forceful personality and unusual
habits, including wearing leather gloves and a veil, and demanding cat
food for her son. Lucia, a newspaper editor, is similarly entrenched in
this strange world, also visiting Anton and sharing a deeply unsettling
bond with him. The narrative focuses on their shared grief and the
bizarre, almost ritualistic, interactions they have within the prison
walls. The story culminates in a moment of unexpected emotional
connection between the two women, a shared acknowledgment of their
shared sorrow and the profound impact Anton’s actions have had on their

demoralizing the public and justifying continued, unfavorable economic

The May 29, 2001, session of the NATO alliance, held in Budapest,
Hungary, marks the first “outbound” session, taking place in a non-NATO
country. Amidst reports of potential U.S. acquisition of Russian S-300
anti-missile systems, U.S. Defense Minister K. Powell is expected to
formally discuss this possibility. The Bush administration seeks to
overcome Russian opposition to U.S. withdrawal from the 1972 treaty.
Simultaneously, the U.S. suggests reviewing Russia’s debt, but European
countries are unlikely to do so unless Russia agrees to exit the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Boris Prodi’s proposed “new century”
platform, including a shift from the dollar to the euro and a refusal to
join the WTO, is viewed unfavorably by Washington. The U.S. is offering
Russia the ability to pursue its foreign policy independently in

as a decadent, stagnant, and ultimately “sick” entity, characterized by
artistic absurdity, social inequality, and historical failings like

respectively. Europe’s attempts to regain influence are dismissed as
futile, and the author suggests a need for new nations to emerge. The
text expresses a fondness for the ideological struggle and a particular
appreciation for the “worthy enemy” that shaped Russian identity during

</p>
<p>

This text details a deeply troubling situation in the Chernorary
district of the Astrakhan region of Russia, stemming from the leadership
of head administrator Petr Konovalov. Over a five-year period, Konovalov
oversaw a catastrophic decline in the district’s economy, marked by
drastically reduced livestock, crop yields, meat, vegetable, milk, egg,
and wool production. Despite this devastation, Konovalov was awarded the
Order “For Merits to the Fatherland” II degree, a decision met with
widespread resentment and despair among the local population.

The core of the problem lies in Konovalov’s policies, which, combined
with a lack of support from regional authorities (including Governor
Anatoly Guzhvin), led to widespread economic ruin. The district’s
fertile land was exploited by outsiders – primarily Korean, Caucasian,
and Central Asian migrants – who often engaged in fraudulent practices,
taking advantage of the local population’s vulnerability. These
individuals frequently exploited loopholes in the system, taking
advantage of the local’s lack of resources and legal protection.

Furthermore, the local scientific institute specializing in arid
agriculture was systematically undermined by regional officials,
hindering their efforts to maintain productivity and innovate. The
situation is compounded by a lack of accountability and a seemingly
deliberate disregard for the well-being of the community. The text
highlights a pattern of corruption, mismanagement, and a failure to
protect the interests of the local population, culminating in a deeply
disheartening and unsustainable situation.

He blames the mismanagement and lack of concern from the DKB

self-preservation over national interests. He criticizes the
leadership’s focus on complaining about budget constraints rather than
taking action, and calls for them to resign to make way for more capable

influenced by concepts like “cellularity” and “light-bearing sources.”
His art, particularly works like “The Feast of Kings” and “The Cowherd,”
depicts these sources—revealing a cyclical, interconnected existence,
emphasizing the enduring nature of human existence and its fundamental

This text is a scathing critique of Russian television and its role in
promoting the sale of land to Russian businessman Vladimir Pozner. It
argues that television is manipulating public opinion, particularly on
“Independence Day,” by falsely celebrating the sale of land as the
“main” holiday and promoting a narrative equating the sale with

The piece highlights the manipulative tactics employed, including using

of the land sale as extremist figures akin to Nazi stormtroopers. It
condemns the lack of transparency and the distortion of reality

The author expresses deep concern about ongoing linguistic “reforms” and

The author argues that these “reforms” are not about improvement, but

importance of preserving the language as a reflection of Russian values

including “kinder surprises” (political operatives), to influence the
outcome through disinformation, smear campaigns, and the strategic
deployment of propaganda.

Key elements include the involvement of figures like Dmitry Saaveliev (a
former Transneft executive), the use of a tabloid newspaper (“Tribunal”)
filled with fabricated stories and propaganda, and the deliberate
confusion of voters by exploiting their lack of reliable information.
The campaign focused on discrediting candidates, particularly Andrey
Klimentiev and Ivan Sklyarov, while promoting figures like Gennady
Khodyrev, despite Khodyrev’s own public stance against “dirty”
campaigning.

The text highlights the manipulative tactics employed to create division
among the electorate and ultimately ensure the victory of a candidate
favored by the Kremlin, regardless of their actual qualifications or
policies. It portrays a system where genuine political debate is
deliberately obscured by a barrage of misinformation and strategic
deception.

Konstantin Pchelnikov (1924-2001) was a prominent Russian intellectual
and architect known for his futuristic architectural theories and
innovative social models. He developed concepts like the “kinetic
settlement system,” recognized at the 1972 Osaka World’s Fair, and
explored connections between architecture, technology, anthropology, and
geopolitics. Pchelnikov, a passionate believer in Russia’s future, died
tragically in a car accident. He was described as a visionary and a

This text is a lengthy, highly critical, and somewhat rambling response
to a journalist’s investigation into the arrest of Eduard Limonov. The
author, Юрий Poliakov, a writer and editor, argues that the
investigation is a politically motivated fabrication designed to
discredit Limonov and, by extension, anyone associated with him. He
claims the journalist, Dmitry Belovetsky, is manipulating quotes from
Limonov’s writings to create a false narrative, portraying Limonov as a
fascist and a revolutionary.

Poliakov contends that the entire situation is orchestrated by the FSB
and the prosecution, using fabricated evidence and manipulated quotes to
justify Limonov’s arrest and a harsh sentence in Latvia. He expresses
cynicism towards literary solidarity, pointing to instances of liberal
writers abandoning Limonov in the past. He accuses the journalist of
employing a “propaganda” style, twisting Limonov’s words and creating a
deliberately inflammatory portrayal.

Ultimately, Poliakov suggests that the investigation is a cynical
attempt to silence dissent and control the narrative, highlighting a
pattern of politically motivated actions and the manipulation of truth.
He concludes by asserting that the journalist’s work is a deliberate
attempt to smear Limonov and discredit anyone who supports him.

This text presents a highly symbolic and somewhat fantastical critique
of contemporary Russia, particularly focusing on the concentration of
wealth and power in the hands of a small elite. It describes a landscape
of opulent estates and bizarre architectural structures – resembling
ancient temples, palaces, and even a golden toilet – built along the
Rublevskoye Highway, a symbolic route connecting Moscow with the
suburbs. These estates are populated by figures representing the new
Russian elite: former Communist officials, businessmen, and figures
associated with the 1990s privatization. The text uses imagery of
ancient myths and religious symbolism (the golden toilet, the angel, the
serpent) to represent the corruption and moral decay associated with
this new power structure. It suggests a cyclical pattern of destruction
and renewal, with a final, apocalyptic event promising to cleanse the
land of this corruption. The entire piece is a highly allegorical and
somewhat paranoid exploration of power, wealth, and the perceived loss

This text is a highly critical and speculative piece detailing the
events surrounding the disappearance of Belarusian journalists and
figures critical of President Lukashenko. It argues that the “death
squads” narrative, initially fueled by Western media and opposition
groups, was a deliberate manipulation designed to destabilize Belarus
and potentially justify intervention. The author contends that the
accusations of a formal “death squad” were fabricated, stemming from a
combination of misinformation, manipulated evidence, and the desperate
attempts of opposition figures to discredit Lukashenko.

The piece highlights a pattern of fabricated accusations, starting with
the disappearance of Gongaudz and Zavadzki, and amplified by the
creation of the “death squad” narrative. It details how this narrative
was exploited by Western media and opposition groups, aiming to
influence the upcoming presidential elections. The author suggests that
the accusations were strategically deployed to create a climate of fear

The text emphasizes the role of Western media and opposition groups in

2001-08-13 - <b> Aleksey Tsvetkov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of advertising, arguing that it’s not
simply a persuasive tool, but a fundamentally manipulative force shaping
our desires and perceptions. The author, Alexei Kuznetkov, uses the
example of a television commercial series (“Рондо”) to illustrate how
advertising constructs a false reality, promoting a consumerist ideology
that equates wealth with happiness and influence.

The core argument is that advertising doesn’t just sell products; it
sells a specific way of life – a “bourgeois harmony” – and actively
suppresses alternative ways of thinking and being. It does this by
creating a constant stream of desires, framing choices as essential for
a fulfilling life, and ultimately, controlling our attention and
behavior.

The text highlights the absurdity of this process, pointing out how
advertising creates a simulated world where people are encouraged to
accept a manufactured reality, even if it’s based on superficial desires
and empty promises. It suggests that advertising operates as a form of
social control, subtly shaping our values and beliefs.

Furthermore, the author critiques the very concept of “democracy”
through the lens of advertising, arguing that it’s a system where we are
constantly being marketed to, and that the relentless pursuit of
consumerism is a form of enslavement. The final section examines the
irony of advertising promoting itself, suggesting that it’s a necessary
evil that we must tolerate in order to maintain a semblance of a
“normal” life. The text ultimately calls for a critical awareness of
advertising’s manipulative power and a rejection of its manufactured
desires.

The text expresses deep concern and outrage regarding the situation in
Transnistria, a region of Moldova with a significant Russian military
presence and a predominantly Russian-speaking population. It details a
perceived betrayal by the Russian government, specifically the
dismantling of the 14th Army (OGRV) and the destruction of its military
equipment by Russian forces under the guise of peacekeeping. The author
accuses the Russian government, led by Putin, of abandoning Transnistria
to the influence of NATO and the West, despite the region’s historical
loyalty to Russia.

The core argument is that this action is driven by a cynical calculation
– a gradual surrender of Russian territory to the West. The text
highlights escalating tensions, including protests by Transnistrian
residents, attacks on activists, and the forced labor of Russian
soldiers digging defensive trenches. It portrays a situation where the

causing the muse to depart. Despite this, the muse periodically returns,
particularly during the summer months, and a local poet, George Melnik,

<p>

This text presents a highly critical and alarmist analysis of the
current situation in Crimea, primarily focusing on the growing influence
and ambitions of the Crimean Tatar community, particularly through the
leadership of the Mejlis. The author argues that this influence,
combined with support from Ukraine’s security services and external
actors like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, is creating a volatile and
potentially dangerous environment.

The core argument is that the Crimean Tatars, fueled by a desire for
self-determination and supported by external forces, are systematically
marginalizing the remaining Slavic population of Crimea. The text
details a series of concerning developments, including: the alleged
involvement of Ukrainian intelligence services in facilitating Tatar
migration, the establishment of training camps for Tatar “fighters” in
Crimea, and the potential for a future conflict mirroring the situations
in Kosovo and Chechnya, with Crimea potentially becoming a “Ukrainian
Chechnya.”

The author suggests that the situation is exacerbated by demographic
shifts, with Tatars increasingly dominating the population, and that
this could lead to a violent displacement of the Slavic population. The
text paints a picture of a carefully orchestrated plan by external
actors to destabilize Crimea and ultimately create a new state based on
Tatar dominance, supported by a network of training camps, external
funding, and potentially armed conflict. The author concludes with a
bleak prediction of a future where Crimea is divided along ethnic lines,
with the Slavic population forcibly displaced.

The article discusses the ongoing tensions surrounding the US and
Russia’s 1972 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the
deployment of the US missile defense system, known as ПРО. The core
argument is that the US is attempting to manipulate the treaty to gain a
strategic advantage, primarily by limiting Russia’s ability to develop
and deploy its own missile defense systems.

The US aims to force Russia to “correct” the treaty, restricting its
strategic capabilities, while simultaneously leveraging this situation
to justify the development of the US’s own ПРО. The article argues that
a US unilateral withdrawal from the treaty would be highly beneficial to
Russia, allowing it to pursue independent military development,
including the deployment of anti-satellite weapons, and dominate the
global arms market.

President Putin’s stance on the treaty is therefore crucial, not only
for Russia’s national security but also for his own political standing.
The article concludes that Putin’s firm position is essential to
maintain Russia’s strategic autonomy and economic interests in the arms
trade.

This text is a critical analysis of the United States’ aerial campaign
in Afghanistan following the September 11th attacks. The author argues
that the bombing campaign is largely ineffective due to the Taliban’s
tactics – their constant movement, reliance on improvised defenses (like
RPGs), and the difficulty in accurately targeting them. The piece draws
a parallel to the NATO intervention in Serbia, highlighting how inflated
the initial assessments of NATO’s success were, and how the actual
military impact was minimal. The author suggests the current campaign is
primarily a “demonstrative” effort, intended to project American power
and influence, rather than a genuinely effective military operation. The
reliance on the “Northern Alliance” to achieve further gains is viewed
with skepticism, and the author expresses concern that the conflict will
likely be prolonged and ultimately unsuccessful, with the US relying on
a protracted air campaign rather than ground troops. The overall tone is
pessimistic, suggesting a costly and potentially futile endeavor.

The text presents a collection of viewpoints regarding the United
States’ actions in Afghanistan and Russia’s response. Multiple experts –
a writer, a general, a priest, a political scientist, and an economist –
offer differing perspectives. The core argument is that the U.S. aims to
establish global dominance, encompassing economic, cultural, and
military spheres, with a specific focus on establishing a “one-polar
world.” Concerns are raised about a potential “cold war” revival and a
calculated provocation against Russia. Russia’s response is viewed as
needing to prioritize its own internal stability and strategic balance,
maintaining relationships with diverse partners like Europe, the U.S.,
China, and India, while avoiding emotional or short-sighted decisions. A
key takeaway is the need for Russia to strategically distance itself
from American influence through measured actions, particularly regarding

</p>
<p>

This text is a scathing critique of the Russian government’s response to
the country’s demographic crisis, primarily focusing on the 2001
“Demographic Development Concept.” The author, Boris Khorev, argues that
the government deliberately downplayed the severity of the situation,
omitting crucial sections about national security threats and failing to
implement effective demographic policies. He criticizes the government’s
focus on easing the lives of private individuals while ignoring the
plight of the Russian people, particularly multi-child families.

Khorev expresses deep frustration with the inaction of figures like
Minister of Labor Pochnik and Deputy Minister Dmitrijev, who he
perceives as simply “shooting the messenger” rather than addressing the
root causes of the declining birth rate and rising mortality. He uses a
personal anecdote – the experience of a family in the region of
Kirovskoe, Kurgan Oblast – to illustrate the government’s indifference.

The core of the argument is that the government’s policies are driven by
a “cannibalistic” approach to economic reform, prioritizing private gain
over the well-being of the nation. Khorev calls for a declaration of a
demographic emergency and proposes measures including economic and
demographic interventions, combating social pathologies like drug and
alcohol abuse, and prioritizing the health and well-being of the Russian
people. He concludes with a stark warning: the government’s inaction
threatens the very survival of the Russian nation.

author, a former naval officer, argues strongly against the closure,
citing historical precedent, strategic considerations, and potential
geopolitical consequences. He details the history of Soviet naval
activity in the region, particularly the establishment of Camranh Bay as
a vital supply and maintenance point for the 8th Fleet (based in the
Indian Ocean) following unsuccessful agreements with Egypt.

The author expresses deep skepticism about the purported cost savings of
closing the base, arguing that it’s strategically crucial for Russia’s
naval operations in the volatile Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. He
criticizes the decision as short-sighted, potentially limiting Russia’s
ability to respond to global security threats, and suggests that it
would likely be taken over by other powers like the United States or
China. He references historical agreements with Egypt and Vietnam,
highlighting the difficulties in securing long-term, reliable naval
bases. The author concludes by advocating for maintaining the base until
2004, arguing that closing it prematurely would be detrimental to
Russia’s national interests.

On November 7, 2001, the Moscow Communist Party will hold a traditional
demonstration and rally. However, destructive forces are planning a
political provocation on the State holiday, aiming to discredit the
Great October Socialist Revolution. The Communist Party blames the
authorities for failing to prevent clashes between the two groups and
asserts responsibility if such conflicts occur. The demonstration will
take place regardless of the weather, with a gathering at October Square
near Lenin’s monument at 9:30 AM.

2001-11-04 - <b> Olʹga Shorina </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a darkly comedic and unsettling narrative centered around a
web of interconnected characters and misfortunes in a small Russian
town. It details the plight of Polina Shorina, a retired physics teacher
suffering from arteriosclerosis, who disappears after a series of
increasingly bizarre and frustrating encounters. The story unfolds
through a series of vignettes, highlighting the systemic issues of
poverty, neglect, and exploitation within the healthcare system.

Key elements include: a corrupt and ineffective healthcare system,
characterized by overworked and underpaid medical staff, and a pervasive
atmosphere of distrust and desperation. The narrative focuses on the
incompetence and self-serving behavior of individuals like Pavel Belikov
(Polina’s grandson), Lubonets (a seemingly benevolent but ultimately
manipulative caregiver), and others who exploit the vulnerability of the
elderly and sick.

The story is marked by a sense of fatalism and absurdity, with multiple
characters suffering tragic fates – including Polina’s death – due to a
combination of systemic failures and individual misjudgments. The
interconnectedness of the characters and their shared experiences create
a bleak and unsettling portrait of a community struggling with poverty,
illness, and a lack of basic social support. The narrative culminates in
a series of coincidences and unfortunate events, ultimately leading to
the demise of several characters and reinforcing the sense of
hopelessness.

</p>
<p>

This text presents a complex argument surrounding the disputed Kuril
Islands between Russia and Japan. It outlines several “paradoxes”
highlighting the difficulties in resolving the territorial dispute.
Firstly, Japan’s insistence on calling the southern Kuril Islands
“Japanese” despite their geographical location and Russia’s historical
claims. Secondly, Japan’s attempts to justify its claims by highlighting
past apologies for wartime actions, particularly regarding the 1995
acknowledgement of responsibility for the war. Thirdly, the paradox of
Japan demanding the return of the islands despite the legal implications
of the San Francisco Treaty, which Russia, as the successor state to the
Soviet Union, is bound by.

The author argues that Russia has a legal basis to resolve this issue by
formally recognizing the San Francisco Treaty of 1951, which Japan has
agreed to. This would solidify the legal foundation for Russia’s claims
and allow for a more stable and mutually respectful relationship. The
text also addresses criticisms leveled against the book “Пропущенные
вехи…” (Missed Landmarks) by V.V. Aladinin, arguing that these
criticisms are based on a biased perspective and fail to acknowledge
Russia’s legitimate claims. Finally, the text emphasizes the importance
of a legal framework based on international law and mutual respect for
resolving the dispute, supported by figures like Viktor Bogdanov and the
support of Russian legislators.

<p>

The author, Denis Tukmakov, explores the complex question of what
constitutes a “leader,” specifically focusing on Vladimir Putin. He
questions the public’s understanding of Putin’s intentions, beliefs, and
ambitions, arguing that a definitive answer is elusive. The text
examines various qualities traditionally associated with a leader –
charisma, the ability to respond to historical challenges, a vision for
the nation’s future, and the capacity to embody the aspirations of the
people.

The author rejects simplistic comparisons, such as contrasting Putin
with Stalin or Kalita, arguing that a true leader must be reflective of
the people themselves. He expresses a desire for Putin to be a
reflection of his own hopes and dreams, a shared vision where “the
leader is me.” The piece ultimately highlights the difficulty in
defining leadership and the importance of a leader’s connection to the
populace, questioning whether Putin truly embodies this connection.

This text critiques the Russian television program “Za Steklom” (Behind
Glass), arguing it’s deliberately cultivating a base of viewers by
exploiting primal desires and promoting a degraded, animalistic
behavior. The program, featuring individuals in a glass enclosure, is
seen as a deliberate strategy to “bydhlize” the population – reducing
people to a base level of aggression and competition, mirroring a “new
world order.” The author highlights the program’s manipulation of
viewers’ curiosity, voyeurism, and fascination with conflict, comparing
it to a ruthless “business” where survival depends on consuming others.
Concerns are raised about the program’s potential influence on youth and
the broader societal implications of this kind of exploitative media.
There’s speculation that NTV intends to replicate the program,
suggesting a broader trend of degraded content and manipulation within

TRIUMPH MOLI

<p>
2001-11-19 - <b> Andrey Fefelov </b>
</p>
<p>

This text is a darkly humorous and deeply skeptical analysis of Vladimir
Putin’s enduring and somewhat baffling popularity. It portrays Putin as
a mythical figure, a “phantom” born from the lingering hopes and
anxieties of a Russian populace disillusioned after decades of Soviet
collapse. The author argues that Putin’s appeal isn’t based on genuine
leadership, but rather on a carefully cultivated image – a blend of
charisma, ambiguity, and a willingness to offer simple answers to
complex problems.

The piece uses a Gogolian style, employing fantastical imagery – like
the “two unusual rats” – and a sense of unease to highlight the
disconnect between Putin’s public persona and the reality of his rule.
It suggests that Putin’s power rests not on competence, but on the
collective desire for a strong leader, a “blessed” figure who can
provide reassurance and a sense of stability, even if that stability is
built on illusion.

Ultimately, the text presents a bleak view of Putin’s legacy, suggesting
that his power is rooted in a carefully constructed myth, one that will
likely fade as quickly as it arose, leaving behind only a lingering
sense of bewilderment and a feeling that the “real” Russia remains
hidden beneath the surface. It ends with a final, unsettling note,
echoing Gogolian themes of deception and the unknowable nature of power.

</p>
<p>

This text is a dense, surreal, and philosophical exploration of waste,
death, and the cyclical nature of existence. It presents a fragmented,
almost dreamlike narrative centered around a sprawling, polluted
landfill (“the ‘garbage dump’,” or “the ‘polygone’”) as a microcosm of
human history and the universe itself. The author uses vivid, often
grotesque imagery – decaying bodies, overflowing garbage, bizarre
figures – to examine themes of mortality, transformation, and the
potential for renewal.

The landfill isn’t simply a place of discarded materials; it’s a site of
profound spiritual and historical significance. It represents a
repository of lost souls, a place where the remnants of civilizations
and individual lives accumulate, and where the boundaries between the
living and the dead blur. The narrative suggests a continuous cycle of
creation and destruction, with waste serving as a catalyst for rebirth
and transformation.

The text employs a variety of stylistic techniques, including stream of
consciousness, symbolism, and grotesque realism, to create a
disorienting and unsettling effect. It questions conventional notions of
value and meaning, suggesting that even the most degraded and discarded
things can hold a profound and unsettling beauty. The author uses the
landfill as a metaphor for the human condition, highlighting our
inevitable decay and the potential for redemption through acceptance and
transformation. Ultimately, the text is a meditation on the
interconnectedness of all things and the enduring power of hope in the
face of oblivion.

The text critiques the extensive, state-controlled media campaign
surrounding the Kursk submarine disaster. It argues that the campaign,
orchestrated by figures like Korablev and others, aimed to manipulate
public opinion and falsely portray the disaster as a result of Russian
command’s actions, specifically to bolster the image of the President
and foster a sense of national helplessness. The media focused on
misleading narratives about the cause of the sinking, emphasizing the
need to cut off the bow of the submarine, and ultimately sought to
silence dissenting voices, particularly those of Admiral Popov and
Admiral Mozak, who maintained that the Kursk had collided with a foreign
submarine, likely American. The author expresses concern that this
propaganda aimed to transform the Russian population into a docile,
subservient populace, rather than confronting the true source of the

The text discusses the creation of a financial intelligence unit in
Russia, primarily in response to widespread money laundering,
particularly involving narcotics trafficking and linked to a
proliferation of banks. It highlights the difficulty in detecting and
combating this activity due to the complexity of the financial system,
the use of deceptive tactics like posing as elderly women or using shell
companies, and the sheer number of banks operating, many of which were
poorly regulated and involved in “grey” operations. The author describes
a situation where money laundering had become commonplace, with
techniques like using exchange offices and even posing as ordinary
citizens to move illicit funds. The creation of the financial
intelligence unit, spearheaded by a veteran figure previously associated
with the FSB (KGB), is presented as a belated response to this systemic
problem, particularly in the lead-up to an upcoming presidential
election. The text emphasizes the scale of the challenge – a complex web
of interconnected banks, shadowy figures, and deceptive practices – and
suggests that the new unit will face a difficult battle to bring order
to the financial system.

This text is a scathing critique of Russian state television’s coverage,

subsequent events. The author argues that Russian television
consistently promotes a biased narrative, glorifying figures associated

Specifically, the author criticizes the channel’s selective remembrance

This text is a scathing critique of Russian television and its role in

dissatisfaction with two televised shows: one featuring the staged
“trial” of a “terrorist” (referred to as “Terrorist No. 2”) and another
showcasing the manipulated “elections” in the Republic of Sakha

The author argues that both shows are deliberately designed to glorify

</p>
<p>

This text is a 2001 essay by Michael Novoselov, a Russian Orthodox
writer, addressing the issue of “the voice of the Church.” Novoselov
critiques the tendency within the Russian Orthodox Church to rely on the
pronouncements of figures like Patriarch Тихон and others, arguing that
people struggle to understand what constitutes the Church’s “voice.” He
highlights the historical context of debates surrounding “numbers” (INN)
and the authority of figures like Metropolitan Иоанн Крестьянкин.

Novoselov strongly rejects the idea of hierarchical infallibility,
particularly as expressed by the Synod, citing the 1913 Synodical
Message which asserted the infallibility of the hierarchy. He argues
that true understanding of the Church’s voice comes not from official
pronouncements, but from a deeper, personal faith and love, emphasizing
the importance of individual conscience and participation in the Church.
He draws a parallel to the dangers of blindly accepting authority,
referencing the example of Leo Tolstoy and the potential for confusion
within the Church. Ultimately, Novoselov advocates for a faith-based
understanding of the Church’s voice, rejecting the notion of a single,
infallible authority.
