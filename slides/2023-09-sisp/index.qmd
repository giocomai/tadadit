## The project: Text as data & data in the text

**Studying conflicts in post-Soviet spaces through structured analysis of textual contents available on-line**

# Starting point

In post-Soviet area studies:

-   so much of our research process is based on online sources
-   our encounter with online sources is overwhelmingly serendipitous
-   it's all fine, but we're missing out

## What are the benefits of a structured approach?

-   find the needle
-   characterise the haystack (or put the needle in context)
-   validate, dismiss, correct assumptions more efficiently
-   case selection, timeframe selection
-   be in the position to describe what you did, and, if you didn't find what you were looking for, *move on*

# Structured â‰  quantitative

-   "structured" does not imply quantitative approaches
-   "structured" does not imply epistemological re-thinking

## Examples

-   **discoursive:**
    -   has Crimea been prominent in official or media discourse before 2014?
    -   when did this obsession with Russophobia, denazification, etc. start?
-   **finding data/evidence:**
    -   all sentences in Transnistria's news that include "pension" AND either digits, percent, or rouble

## Who's using structured approaches?

-   Mostly people for whom the method is central to their research:
    -   quantitatively-oriented researchers (text as data)
    -   media analysts
-   but their methods are often difficult to access for researchers with a different background

## What are the obstacles?

-   technical complexity
-   costs
-   licensing issues
-   limited availability of ready-to-use corpora

## How can we overcome these obstacles?

-   technical complexity -> community
-   costs -> community
-   licensing issues -> community
-   limited availability of ready-to-use corpora -> community

## Easier access

### Pre-processed corpora

- [https://tadadit.xyz/datasets/](https://tadadit.xyz/datasets/){preview-link="true"}
- [https://discuss-data.net/](https://discuss-data.net/)

### Licensing

1. interface: just a custom search engine?
2. share it within research networks?
3. share recipe to replicate

# Why bother?

- maybe it's not really useful
- obviously, there's not a sensible incentive structure
- why bother, really?
- if we think of ourselves as a __community__ of scholars, maybe this can work and enhance our research workflows
