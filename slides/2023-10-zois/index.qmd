## Theoretical starting point

Similarly to other **small dependent jurisdictions**, post-Soviet de facto states...

1.  receive a large share of their **budget incomes from external sources**
2.  have an unusually high amount of residents whose income depends directly on the (de facto) state (e.g. **pensioners, public sector employees, military**)
3.  have an economy strongly influenced by **migration and remittances**

## As a consequence...

Even if a lot of subsistence and informal economy goes unrecorded, a sizeable part of the economy is fully formalised **in a way that leaves some record**:

-   external assistance from the patron is largely **officially recorded in budgets**
-   pensions and salaries for some categories are either **public or publicly object of debate**
-   relevant indicators are often **publicly discussed** (e.g. number of pensioners, number of teachers, health sector workers, etc.)

# Socio-economic indicators in post-Soviet de facto states

## Why do we care?

-   questions of political economy
-   degree of external dependency
-   economic opportunities structure
-   but also, more pragmatic:
    -   salaries & migration choices
    -   possibly, political or even status preferences
    -   e.g. how much does Transnistria need if assistance through gas is cut?

### Getting the data

-   sometimes, readily available
-   sometimes, it's really many needles scattered around many haystacks

### Trusting the data

-   to what extent should we trust them
-   or, which data can we trust, and what's excluded

### Making the data comparable:

-   exchange rates, inflation, etc.
-   "per capita" and demography

# The (relatively) easy part

-   when data is mostly readily available
-   but still needs to be adjusted for exchange rate and inflation
-   per capita and purchasing power parity

## Budget assistance (in RUB)

## Budget assistance (in USD)

## Exchange rates matter

But there's more...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Inflation-adjusted and "per capita"

For established economies, it's easy to find data in constant LCU or constant USD. Alternatives here?

-   statistics on inflation released or made public by de facto authorities
-   data from the patron or neighbouring region
-   find historical prices for selected goods (e.g. electricity, diesel at the pump, etc.)
-   **demography is an even bigger issue**

### This matters both for domestic dynamics and comparison

## Plus, local peculiarities

e.g. Transnistria

-   we know how much gas Transnistria receives
-   we know how much that would cost, if Moldova were to pay for it
-   but what is actually its value for the Transnistrian economy?
-   and how is that value distributed, besides the budget?

## In brief

-   getting data that is good enough for analysis or comparison may require extra work but may still be feasible, **depending on the research question**
-   **depending on the research question**, we may instead prefer looking for disaggregated data
    -   about some sectors of the economy
    -   about some groups of people whose incomes we may realistically know and compare

# Some bottom-up stats

A part of the story, of varying size

# Finding the needles in the haystacks

# First, get the haystacks

Corpora of relevant online sources

## Textual datasets of relevant online sources

-   websites of de facto authorities
-   local news websites
-   possibly, websites of selected commercial activities
-   selected sources in the patron state

## From website to corpus

```{r results='asis'}
library("castarter")
cas_set_options(
  base_folder = fs::path(fs::path_home_r(), 
                         "R",
                         "castarter_tadadit"),
  project = "Transnistria media",
  website = "novostipmr.com_ru" 
)

corpus_df <- cas_read_db_contents_data() %>% 
  #dplyr::collect() |> 
  dplyr::filter(is.na(date)==FALSE)

max_date <- max(as.Date(corpus_df |> dplyr::pull(date)))

min_date <- min(as.Date(corpus_df |> dplyr::pull(date)))

total_items <- corpus_df |> dplyr::count() |> dplyr::pull(n) 
body_text <- stringr::str_c(
  "**Dataset name**: novostipmr.com_ru",
  "**Dataset description**: All items published on the website of Transnistria's news agency Novosti PMR",
  paste("**Start date**:", min_date),
  paste("**End date**:", max_date),
  paste("**Total items**:", scales::number(total_items)),
  paste("**Available columns**:", colnames(corpus_df) %>% 
          stringr::str_c(collapse = "; ")),
  sep = "\n\n")

cat(body_text)
```

# Then, parse them for the needles

Structured analysis of online contents

## For example {background-image="img/transnistria_castarter_screenshot.png" background-position="bottom" background-size="70% 70%"}


### Data about pensioners in Transnistria

## For example {background-image="img/transnistria_castarter_screenshot2.png" background-size="70% 70%" background-position="bottom"}

### Data about pensioners in Transnistria

## For example {background-image="img/transnistria_blokad.png" background-size="70% 70%" background-position="bottom"}

### When a given issue received attention



# This technique can be used to...

-   get data, across a wide range of issues
-   triangulate
-   put in context
-   reality check

# By the way... is it OK do this?

-   "Text and data mining for the purposes of scientific research" is explicitly allowed by a 2019 EU directive
-   even beyond research, same conditions as would apply e.g. to search engines remain valid
-   full corpus can be publicly shared only when license allows for it

# Taking care of the haystacks:

-   keeping them updated
-   but also, long time preservation
-   consider what can be shared

## Even established online sources disappear

- new president deletes statements of previous presidents (e.g. Georgia, Ukraine, etc.)
- institutions, organisations, or entities change or disappear
- selective removal of old contents (less common, but recorded e.g. in [Transnistria post-Shevchuk](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Transnistria/After-a-new-president-came-to-power-what-happened-to-Transnistria-s-media-188493))
- old contents are not moved to new websites
- some things may remain on the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), many (most?) are likely lost

## Some may remain in personal archives, but are effectively lost (or, are they?) {background-image="img/novosti_pmr_collage.png" background-size="66% 66%" background-position="bottom"}

# How much can we trust these data points?

## Context and corroboration

-   overall statistics may be problematic, but local data more likely to be accurate
-   formal or informal corroboration from multiple sources, online and offline (fieldwork still matters)
-   hacked and dumped materials can be used for triangulation (e.g. #SurkovLeaks), but consider ethics
-   **acknowledge uncertainty**
-   but don't be overwhelmed by it: official stats from around the world are often a (misleading) mess



## An example

![](img/cg_top.png)

-   inflation-adjusted estimates
-   demographic estimates corroborated with local administrative documents
-   geolocation and data retrieved through structured analysis of online contents

## Some things I have not discussed

-   trade
    -   much of the above applies
-   military assistance and spending
    -   this is difficult, both conceptually and practically

## What's next

-   more easily accessible socio-economic indicators
    -   we can get better at sharing them
-   more easily accessible textual datasets
    -   publicly (not without obstacles)
    -   among peers (formal or informal data sharing)
-   (not discussed here)
    -   land-use change satellite data
    -   geocoding and named entity recognition

**Lots can be done as a community of scholars**
